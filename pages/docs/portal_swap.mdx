> Abstract
>
> Portal Swap Protocol is designed to enable any user to perform
> trustless and censorship resistant swaps of crypto assets on different
> blockchains without using wrappers, bridges or other custodian based
> solutions. Portal uses customized HTLC contracts or equivalent smart
> contracts on different blockchains to accomplish cross-chain atomic
> swaps. The architecture is designed modularly so that clients can use
> any of the following combinations : Layer 1 to Layer 1 swaps, Layer 1
> to Layer 2 swaps, or Layer 2 to Layer 2 swaps on different blockchain
> networks. Portal Swaps are designed to be modular and independent of
> the underlying matching protocol, i.e. Peer-to-Peer or a Cross-chain
> AMM and thus maintain atomicity regardless of how the maker and taker
> are connected. We have also identified several race conditions and
> designed the protocol with proper incentives to mitigate some of the
> issues like lockup griefing etc. In this paper we focus exclusively on
> how swap contracts are designed and implemented in the Portal network
> and we illustrate several temporal flows using Lightning to Ethereum
> as an example but can be applied across any network that supports
> SHA256 hashing functionality.
>
> Basics of Atomic Swaps
>
> Atomic swaps represent peer-to-peer trading methods employed to
> transfer cryptocurrencies between distinct blockchains without relying
> on trusted third parties.
>
> An atomic swap protocol ensures the following:  
> ● When all parties adhere to the protocol, the swap occurs as
> intended.
>
> ● If any party deviates from the protocol, no compliant participant
> suffers negative consequences.● No group has economic incentives to
> deviate from the protocol.
>
> Atomic swaps make use of Hashed Time Lock Contracts (HTLCs), which are
> a category of smart contracts designed to facilitate a trustless
> exchange of digital assets. Smart contracts employ an automated
> process that self-executes once all predefined conditions embedded
> within the contract are met.
>
> Bitcoin atomic swaps are possible thanks to two key components encoded
> in Bitcoin’s HTLCs:
>
> Hashlock
>
> The hashlock mechanism enables the contract to be secured with a
> distinct cryptographic key that can solely be created by the depositor
> of the cryptocurrency. This unique key serves as a guarantee that the
> swap is completed when the party with the key (secret, pre-image)
> gives their consent to the transaction.
>
> **Timelocks**
>
> The time lock mechanism can be likened to a time limit for the swap.
> It guarantees that the transaction is finalized within a predefined
> timeframe, and if this condition is not met, it makes it possible for
> the depositor to reclaim their funds. Timelock plays a crucial role in
> ensuring the security of the swap transactions. It mandates that both
> parties must execute the swap within the stipulated time window for a
> successful swap

> **Example of a Simple Atomic Swap Flow**
>
> Alice and Bob agree to exchange 10 X tokens (on x blockchain) for 10 Y
> tokens (on y blockchain) using a Hashed Time Lock Contract (HTLC) set
> to expire in one hour.
>
> First, Alice creates a contract address on x chain and deposits her 10
> X tokens into it, after generating a private key accessible only to
> her, with the stipulation that anyone with the key can unlock and
> spend from the contract, within a specified time period, after which
> she can reclaim the funds. She then generates a cryptographic hash of
> this private key and sends it to Bob. Bob uses this hash to confirm
> that Alice has indeed deposited 10 X tokens into the contract address.
> However, Bob cannot access the funds since he possesses only the hash,
> not the actual private key.
>
> Bob uses the hash to create a new contract address where he deposits
> his 10 Y tokens on the Y blockchain, with the stipulation that anyone
> with the secret key can spend from the contract, for a period of time
> which is less than the timelock in Alice’s contract on X. Now, both
> parties have contributed their funds to the contract. Because Bob
> crafted the address using the hash of Alice's private key, Alice can
> claim the 10 Y tokens deposited by Bob. To do this, she reveals the
> private key on the y blockchain, which presumably Bob monitors and
> obtains. He then has a period of time to use that key to spend X
> tokens from Alice’s contract to his own address. If Bob fails to
> complete the transaction between the time when Alice reveals the key
> on y and before the timelock expires on x, Alice can spend those coins
> back to herself.
>
> If the swap is completed within the specified timeframe, the contract
> is successfully executed and Alice successfully swaps her 10 X tokens
> with Bob in exchange for his 10 Y tokens.
>
> **Atomic swaps vs. bridges**
>
> Atomic swaps enable peer-to-peer exchanges, allowing users to swap
> cryptocurrencies directly without the need for intermediaries. On the
> other hand, cross-chain bridges establish a link between different
> blockchain networks, enabling the seamless transfer of digital assets
> through tokenized representations.
>
> While both cross-chain bridges and atomic swaps contribute to
> improving blockchain interoperability and facilitate the movement of
> cryptocurrencies across various blockchain platforms, they operate
> differently. Cross-chain bridges act as connectors or intermediaries
> that facilitate asset transfers among multiple blockchain networks.
>
> To use cross-chain bridges, a token must be locked on its original
> blockchain, after which a corresponding wrapped token is generated on
> the target chain. This wrapped token is then deposited into a
> liquidity pool on the target blockchain, making it accessible for
> trading, transfer, or redemption for the original assets from the
> source blockchain. Note that the two blockchains are independent,
> internally consistent systems that do not depend on external data to
> maintain or alter their contract states or order of transactions i.e,
> there is no enforcement of the peg or redeemability at the protocol
> level on either chain. Usually, either a single entity or a group of
> entities “guarantees the trust” in the peg between the wrapped token
> and the original token and its redeemability. There have been several
> instances of wrapped token attacks and

5

failures and there is a need for atomicity as opposed to bridges, which
is why Portal chose the harder but

> right way of doing swaps.

> Peer-to-Peer Swaps (V1)
>
> V1 of the Portal Network executes atomic, non-custodial exchange of
> BTC with ETH, ERC20, and other currencies on L1s and L2s. The Network
> is composed of nodes/servers that act as an intermediary between
> multiple clients and multiple L1 and/or L2 networks as depicted in
> Figure 1 below.

> Clients interface with a node using both HTTP and websocket
> connections. Clients create limit orders which are stored in an
> orderbook managed by the network. When two limit orders match
> (currently only exact matches are supported), both counterparties are
> notified via websocket whereupon they may then create a swap order
> whose lifecycle is managed by a node. The node sends messages to both
> counterparties at each phase of the swap lifecycle.
>
> Atomic, non-custodial swaps are implemented using Hashed Time-Locked
> Contracts (HTLC’s) residing on the L1’s or L2’s supporting the
> respective currencies being exchanged, i.e. there is an HTLC on each
> participating L1/L2. HTLC’s contain the hash of a secret bit string
> (the “secret hash”) and are unlocked either when presented with the
> secret that originated the hash or after a time limit has expired.
>
> When creating a swap order, each party supplies a secret hash and the
> node selects one of these for constructing both HTLC’s. The party
> whose secret is chosen is the “secret holder” and the other party is
> the “secret seeker”. The secret holder is responsible for activating
> the HTLC using their in-the-clear, i.e.
>
> un-hashed, secret. Doing so reveals the secret to the secret seeker
> which may then activate their HTLC.

7

> HTLC’s are also constructed with a time limit by which they must be
> activated. After the time limit expires, the HTLC can no longer be
> unlocked with a secret and each party may retrieve their original
> currency any time thereafter.
>
> The following sections describe the temporal sequence of a swap
> lifecycle and the specifics of the HTTP and websocket interfaces.

> Example Swap Flow

> 1\. SecretKnower/Maker initiates the process by generating a random
> 32-byte secret, which is then hashed to create hashOfSecret. An order

> Failure Mode Scenarios of Swaps
>
> In order to determine the requirements for atomic swaps under
> exceptional situations, along unhappy paths, this section explores the
> complex behaviors based on examples.\[\]
>
> Initially let’s consider examples of behavior involving the following
> types of swaps ● Bitcoin L2 \<\> Ethereum L1  
> ● Bitcoin L2 \<\> Ethereum L2  
> ● Bitcoin L2 \<\> Bitcoin L1
>
> For Lightning, we assume the LND implementation for simplicity.
>
> The examples below are created to describe some user scenarios which
> impact security and mitigations, mainly form client side.
>
> Case 1: One party to a lightning swap creates a hodl invoice
>
> No examples known of failures in this scenario
>
> Case 2: One party to a lightning swap pays a hodl invoice
>
> Handle failure or delay
>
> 1\. When a path cannot be found to the other party’s node, alert both
> parties, cancel the invoice, and stop the swap without fault.
>
> 2\. When a payment is stuck, alert both parties, and consider allowing
> either party to cancel the swap without fault. Ensure that payment is
> not retried until after expiry. Warn the paying party to not retry
> payment on his own. Do not allow the swap to be recreated until after
> expiry.
>
> Normally payments are made only after both parties have committed and
> each can no longer 3.
>
> cancel the swap. If other exceptional situations arise that are
> similar to example 2 in that they occur after a payment is made and
> involve a special cancellation, handle the cancellation in a similar
> fashion, cognizant of the expiry. One such case may be if a
> cancellation in example 1 can be stuck.
>
> Case 3: One party to a lightning swap settles a hodl invoice
>
> Handle delay
>
> If the peer in the final HTLC channel does not cooperate and the
> recipient’s lightning node needs to move the HTCL on-chain as a
> result, alert both parties and accommodate the delay.

> Case 4: One party to a lightning swap cancels the swap
>
> Cancel hodl invoice
>
> 1\. After a swap has been opened and before both commitments, allow
> the swap to be canceled. 2. When the swap is canceled, cancel the hodl
> invoice.
>
> 3\. If cancellation of the hodl invoice gets stuck, notify both
> parties, and offer to perform a hard shutdown.
>
> Cancel swap activity on ethereum side
>
> After a swap has been opened and then canceled, stop activity and
> remove state on the ethereum side as necessary.
>
> Case 5: One party to a lightning swap commits the swap
>
> Handle delinquent commits
>
> 1\. After a swap is opened fully and not canceled, if the swap is not
> committed within a certain time in line with existing invoice expiry
> (or anything similar on the ethereum side), then both parties are
> alerted. Any delinquent party is also notified about how much time is
> left before the swap is automatically canceled with fault assigned.
>
> 2\. After an alert is sent, then after another period of time the swap
> is automatically canceled with fault assigned to one or both parties.
>
> Case 6: When multiple orders are created using the same secret hash
>
> Handle failure
>
> Check that the hash of the secret has not been used previously, should
> be a newly created hash. Given a user creates an order with a secret
> hash that had been used on a previous order, then the order is matched
> on the server, it will receive an event swap.created, for which
> returns an object including the swap id and secret hash. Then the
> secret hash will be used to match with previously created orders and
> statuses to“invalid”.
>
> Case 7: When user exits / clears previously create orders
>
> Then order/swap would not complete successfully
>
> Handle failure
>
> Then the relay node should receive a timeout and cancel the order if
> no response is received within a specified time period. Given a user
> creates an order and has refreshed the page, When the order is

16

> matched on the server ,the user will not receive an event
> swap.created. Then the order would stall and will not be able to match
> with any counter party’s request.
>
> Case 8: Invalid parameters in swap order creation
>
> Incorrect numbers are supplied
>
> Handle failure
>
> 1\) disable input of negative number 2) add bounds to input according
> to token decimal places and available balance
>
> Case 9: Insufficient funds
>
> Users cannot swap currencies if they have insufficient funds.
>
> Handle failure
>
> Given a user wants to swap 100 tokens of currency A for currency B and
> the user has only 80 tokens of currency A. When the user tries to
> initiate the swap then the swap should be rejected and the user should
> be notified about insufficient funds and unsuccessful swap operation
>
> Case 10 : Time lock expired
>
> Users cannot complete the swap if the time lock has expired
>
> Handle failure
>
> Given a user has initiated a swap and the time lock for the swap has
> expired. When the user tries to commit the swap, then the swap should
> be canceled instead and both users should be notified about the
> expired time lock and swap cancellation
>
> Case 11: Network Issues
>
> Users cannot complete the swap due to network issues
>
> Handle failure
>
> Given a user has initiated a swap and there are network issues
> resulting in at least one party being disconnected. When the user
> tries to commit the swap, then the swap should be canceled if no
> response is received and the user should be notified about the network
> issues  
> and both users should be notified about the swap cancellation

> Case 12: Griefing/ Free Option Issue
>
> To facilitate atomic exchanges, both parties secure their assets and
> permit their counterpart to withdraw them upon receipt of a secret.
> This situation can give rise to a challenge known as a "griefing
> attack" or the creation of an "American Call option." In this
> scenario, one party ceases their involvement in the exchange, causing
> their counterpart to endure a waiting period until a timelock expires
> before they can access their locked funds.
>
> Handle failure
>
> There are two ways to mitigate the unfairness of an inadvertent call
> option inherent in atomic swaps:
>
> 1\. Eliminate the unintended option, or  
> 2. Internalize the cost of an option so that the option is “priced in”
> with the cost of the swap.
>
> Eliminating the inadvertent option on Layer 1 is not possible, as
> separate blockchains do not communicate with each other. Instead,
> PortalX internalizes the price of the option in the form of
> a“reclaimable deposit/bond”.
>
> In our construction, the cost of the option is included in Alice’s
> Bitcoin HTLC. This internalizes the cost and eliminates inefficiency
> inherent to Tier Nolan atomic swaps (refer to ZK-Swaps White Paper -
> Part 1 v0.02 for details and analysis).
>
> Cross-chain AMM Swaps (V2)
>
> As stated in the previous sections, Portal Swap Protocol is designed
> to be independent of how parties are matched and who the parties are.
> The swap protocol works seamlessly regardless of Peer-to-Peer matching
> or an AMM is used. Essentially, AMM acts as a counterparty or a peer
> but the swap contracts and mechanism remain the same across the
> blockchains. We intend to publish the module of the whitepaper
> describing how Portal’s cross-chain AMM works in the coming weeks.
>
> Complex swap contracts
>
> Swap contracts can be easily extended to support partial fills,
> derivatives and a variety of complex contracts. We will describe these
> complex transactions in more detail in a separate module, to be
> published after the AMM module.
