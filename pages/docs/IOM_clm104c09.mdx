> RHCs are facilities that provide services that are typically furnished
> in an outpatient clinic setting. The statutory requirements that RHCs
> must meet to qualify for the Medicare benefit are in ยง1861(aa) (2) of
> the Social Security Act (the Act).
>
> A RHC visit is defined as a medically-necessary, face-to-face
> (one-on-one) medical or mental health visit, or a qualified preventive
> health visit, with a RHC practitioner during which time one or more
> RHC services are rendered. A RHC practitioner is a physician, nurse
> practitioner (NP), physician assistant (PA), certified nurse midwife
> (CNM), clinical psychologist (CP), and clinical social worker (CSW). A
> Transitional Care Management (TCM) service can also be a RHC visit. A
> RHC visit can also be a visit between a home- bound patient and an RN
> or LPN under certain conditions.
>
> RHCs can be either independent or provider-based. Independent RHCs are
> stand-alone or freestanding clinics and submit claims to a Medicare
> Administrative Contractor (MAC). They are assigned a CMS Certification
> Number (CCN) in the range of XX3800- XX3974 or XX8900-XX8999.
> Provider-based RHCs are an integral and subordinate part of a hospital
> (including a critical access hospital (CAH), skilled nursing facility
> (SNF), or a home health agency (HHA)).

# - FQHC General Information

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> FQHCs are facilities that provide services that are typically
> furnished in an outpatient clinic setting. FQHC services consist of
> services that are similar to those furnished in RHCs. The statutory
> requirements that FQHCs must meet to qualify for the Medicare benefit
> are in
> [[ยง1861(aa)(4)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of
> the Act. An entity that qualifies as a FQHC is assigned a CCN in the
> range of XX1000-XX1199 or XX1800-XX1989.
>
> **NOTE:** Information in this chapter applies to FQHCs that are Health
> Center Program Grantees and Health Center Program Look-Alikes. It does
> not necessarily apply to tribal or urban Indian FQHCs or grandfathered
> tribal (GFT) FQHCs.

# - RHC and FQHC All-Inclusive Rate (AIR) Payment System

> **(Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation:
> 03-31-16)**

# - Per Visit Payment and Exceptions under the AIR

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> RHCs and FQHCs are paid an AIR per visit, except for FQHCs that have
> transitioned to the Medicare Prospective Payment System (PPS). For
> RHCs and FQHCs billing under the AIR, more than one
> medically-necessary face-to-face visit with a RHC or FQHC practitioner
> on the same day is payable as one visit, except for the following
> circumstances:

-   The patient, subsequent to the first visit, suffers an illness or
    > injury that requires additional diagnosis or treatment on the same
    > day, (for example, a patient sees their practitioner in the
    > morning for a medical condition and later in the day has a fall
    > and returns to the RHC/FQHC);

-   The patient has a medical visit and a mental health visit on the
    > same day;

-   The patient has an Initial Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE)
    > and a separate qualified medical and/or mental health visit on the
    > same day;

-   The patient has a Diabetes Self-Management Training (DSMT) or
    > Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) visit on the same day as an
    > otherwise payable medical visit. DSMT and MNT apply to FQHCs only.

# - Payment Limit under the AIR

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> For RHCs and FQHCs that bill under the AIR, Medicare pays 80 percent
> of the RHC or FQHC's AIR, subject to a payment limit, except for RHCs
> that have an exception to the payment limit. An interim rate for newly
> certified RHCs, and for FQHCs certified prior to October, 1, 2014, is
> established based on the RHC's or FQHC's anticipated average cost for
> direct and supporting services. At the end of the cost reporting
> period, the MAC determines the total payment due and reconciles
> payments made during the period with the total payments due.
>
> For FQHCs paid under the AIR, there is a payment limit for FQHCs
> located in an urban area and a payment limit for FQHCs located in a
> rural area. Urban FQHCs are those located within a Metropolitan
> Statistical Area (MSA). Rural FQHCs cannot be reclassified into an
> urban area (as determined by the Bureau of Census) for FQHC payment
> limit purposes. If the FQHC organization includes both urban and rural
> sites
>
> and the FQHC organization files a consolidated cost report, the FQHC
> is paid the lower of the FQHC organization's AIR or a single weighted
> payment limit calculated for the entire FQHC organization. The payment
> limit is weighted by the percentage of urban and rural visits as a
> percentage of total visits for the entire FQHC organization.
>
> RHCs and FQHCs paid under the AIR are required to file a cost report
> annually in order to determine their payment rate. If a RHC or FQHC is
> in its initial reporting period, the MAC calculates an interim rate
> based on a percentage of the per-visit limit, which is then adjusted
> when the cost report is filed.
>
> For information on cost reporting requirements, see the Medicare
> Provider Reimbursement Manual (PRM), at

# - FQHC PPS Payment System

> **(Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation:
> 03-31-16)**

# - Per-Diem Payment and Exceptions under the PPS

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> Section 10501(i)(3)(A) of the Affordable Care Act (Pub. L. 111-148 and
> Pub. L. 111- 152) added section 1834(o) of the Social Security Act to
> establish a Medicare PPS for FQHC services. FQHCs transition to the
> Medicare PPS beginning on October 1, 2014, based on their
> cost-reporting period. All FQHCs are expected to be transitioned to
> the PPS by December 31, 2015.
>
> For FQHCs paid under the PPS, Medicare payment is based on the lesser
> of the FQHC's actual charge or the PPS rate, as determined by the MAC.
> The FQHC PPS rate will be updated annually beginning January 1, 2016.
>
> For FQHCs billing under the PPS, more than one medically-necessary
> face-to-face visit with a FQHC practitioner on the same day is payable
> as one visit, except for the following circumstances:
>
> The patient, subsequent to the first visit, suffers an illness or
> injury that requires additional diagnosis or treatment on the same
> day, (for example, a patient sees their practitioner in the morning
> for a medical condition and later in the day has a fall and returns to
> the FQHC),
>
> The patient has a medical visit and a mental health visit on the same
> day.
>
> Separate payment is not made to FQHCs under the PPS for an IPPE or
> DSMT/MNT visit that is furnished on the same day as another FQHC
> medical visit.

# - Adjustments under the PPS

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> The FQHC PPS rate will be adjusted to account for geographic
> differences in costs by the FQHC geographic adjustment factor (FQHC
> GAF). In calculating the PPS rate, the FQHC GAF will be based on the
> locality of the site where the services are furnished. For FQHC
> organizations with multiple sites, the FQHC GAF may vary depending on
> the location of the FQHC delivery site.
>
> The FQHC PPS rate for a covered visit will be calculated as follows:
>
> Base payment rate x FQHC GAF = PPS rate
>
> Updates to the FQHC GAFs will be made in conjunction with updates to
> the Physician Fee Schedule Geographic Practice Cost Indices for the
> same period and will be posted on CMS's FQHC PPS webpage at
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/FQHCPPS/index.html)
> [[Payment/FQHCPPS/index.html]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Medicare-Fee-for-Service-Payment/FQHCPPS/index.html).
>
> The PPS per-diem rate will be adjusted by a factor of 1.3416 when a
> FQHC furnishes care to a patient who is new to the FQHC (has not been
> a patient at any site that is part of the FQHC organization within the
> previous 3 years) or to a beneficiary receiving an IPPE or an annual
> wellness visit (AWV). This is a composite adjustment factor and only
> one adjustment per day can be applied.
>
> If the patient is new to the FQHC, or the FQHC furnishes an Initial
> Preventive Physical Examination (IPPE) or Annual Wellness Visit (AWV),
> the FQHC PPS rate for a covered visit will be calculated as follows:
>
> Base payment rate x FQHC GAF x 1.3416 = PPS rate
>
> For more information on the FQHC PPS, please see the FQHC PPS Final
> Rule located at:

# - Part B Deductible

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> RHC services are subject to an annual deductible of twenty percent of
> charges for covered services. Effective for dates of service on or
> after January 1, 2011, the deductible is not applicable for certain
> preventive services. Please see section 80 for more information on how
> to bill for preventive services.
>
> RHCs collect the patient's deductible or the portion of the patient's
> deductible that has not already been met. Once RHCs have billed the
> MAC for services, they do not collect
>
> or accept any additional money from the patient for their deductible
> until the MAC notifies the RHC of how much of the deductible has been
> met.
>
> The Part B deductible does not apply to FQHC services.

# - Part B Coinsurance

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> After any applicable deductibles have been satisfied, RHCs and FQHCs
> paid under the AIR system will be paid 80 percent of their AIR. The
> patient is responsible for a coinsurance amount of 20 percent of the
> charges after deduction of the deductible, where applicable.
>
> Effective for dates of service on or after January 1, 2011,
> coinsurance is not applicable for certain preventive services. See
> section 80 of this manual for information on how to bill for
> preventive services on a RHC and FQHC claims.
>
> FQHCs paid under the PPS will be paid 80 percent of the lesser of the
> FQHC's actual charge for the specific payment code or the adjusted PPS
> rate. The patient is responsible for a coinsurance amount of 20
> percent of the lesser of the FQHC's actual charge for the specific
> payment code or the adjusted PPS rate. See section 60.2 for more
> information on the FQHC specific payment codes.

## Modifiers, FL 44

> The FQHC reports modifier 59 when billing for a subsequent injury or
> illness. This is not to be used when a patient sees more than one
> practitioner on the same day, or has multiple encounters with the same
> practitioner on the same day, unless the patient, subsequent to the
> first visit, leaves the FQHC and then suffers an illness or injury
> that requires additional diagnosis or treatment on the same day.
>
> Modifier 59 is the FQHC's attestation that the patient, subsequent to
> the first visit, suffers an illness or injury that requires additional
> diagnosis or treatment on the same day.
>
> Modifier 59 should only be used when reporting unrelated services that
> occurred at separate times during the day (e.g., the patient had left
> the FQHC and returned later in the day for an unscheduled visit for a
> condition that was not present during the first visit).
>
> For claims subject to the FQHC PPS, modifier 59 is only valid with
> FQHC Payment Code G0467. Please see section 60.2 of this manual for
> more information on the FQHC Payment Codes.

## Service Date, FL 45

> Medicare requires a line item dates of service for all outpatient
> claims. Medicare classifies RHC/FQHC claims as outpatient claims.
> Non-payment service revenue codes -- report dates as described in the
> table above under Revenue Codes.
>
> Line items on outpatient claims under HIPAA require reporting of a
> line-item service date for each iteration of revenue code. A single
> date must be reported on a line item for the date the service was
> provided, not a range of dates.
>
> For services that do not qualify as a billable visit, the usual
> charges for the services are added to those of the qualified visit.
> RHCs/FQHCs use the date of the visit as the single date on the line
> item. If there is no is billable visit associated with the services,
> then no claim is filed.

## Service Units, FL 46

> The RHC/FQHC enters the number of units for each type of service.
> Units represent visits, which are paid based on the AIR or the FQHC
> PPS, no matter how many services are delivered. Only one visit is
> billed per day unless the patient leaves and later returns with a
> different illness or injury suffered later on the same day.

## Total Charges, FL 47

> The RHC/FQHC enters the total charge for the service described on each
> revenue code line.

## Payer Name, FL 50

> The RHC/FQHC identifies the appropriate payer(s) for the claim.

## National Provider Identifier (NPI) -- Billing Provider, FL 56

> The RHC/FQHC enters its own NPI. When more than one encounter/visits
> is reported on the same claim i.e., medical and mental health visits,
> please choose the NPI of the provider that furnished the majority of
> the services.

## Principal Diagnosis Code, FL 67

> The RHC/FQHC enters diagnosis coding as required by ICD-9-CM or
> ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines.

## Other Diagnosis Codes, FL 67A-Q

> The RHC/FQHC enters diagnosis coding as required by ICD-9-CM or
> ICD-10-CM Coding Guidelines.

## Attending Provider Name and Identifiers, FL 76

> The RHC/FQHC enters the NPI and name of the attending physician
> designated by the patient as having the most significant role in the
> determination and delivery of the patient's medical care.

## Other Provider Name and Identifiers, FL78-79

> The RHC/FQHC enters the NPI and name
>
> **NOTE:** For electronic claims using version 5010 or later, this
> information is reported in Loop ID 2310F -- Referring Provider Name.

# - Billing Requirements for RHCs and FQHCs

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> RHCs and FQHCs are institutional claims and are submitted to the MAC
> on TOB 71x and 77x. Generally, only those services that are included
> in the RHC and FQHC benefits are billed on these claims.

-   The RHC and FQHC benefits are defined in Pub. 100-02, Medicare
    > Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 13
    > ([[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/Downloads/bp102c13.pdf]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/manuals/Downloads/bp102c13.pdf).)

> All professional services in the RHC and FQHC benefit are paid through
> the AIR system or the FQHC PPS payment for each patient encounter or
> visit. Technical services (or technical components of services with
> both professional and technical components) are not billed on RHC/FQHC
> claims.
>
> For FQHCs with cost reporting periods beginning on or after October 1,
> 2014, all services are paid according to the FQHC PPS methodology. The
> visit rate includes: covered services provided by a FQHC practitioner
> and services and supplies furnished incident to the visit. For
> additional information on FQHC services, see the Medicare Policy
> Manual, Chapter 13.

# - Billing Guidelines for RHCs and FQHC Claims under the AIR System

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> When billing Medicare, FQHCs must report all services provided during
> the encounter/visit by listing the appropriate HCPCS code. The
> additional revenue lines with detailed HCPCS code(s) are for
> information and data gathering purposes. RHCs are only required to
> report the appropriate revenue code for medical and mental health
> services.
>
> Encounters with more than one health professional and multiple
> encounters with the same health professionals that take place on the
> same day and at a single location generally constitute a single visit.
> For FQHCs, payment is applied to the service line with revenue code
> 052X and a valid evaluation and management (E&M) HCPCS code for
> medical visits and revenue code 0900 for mental health visits. Since
> RHCs are not required to reported detailed HCPCS codes, the payment is
> applied to the service line with revenue code 052X for medical and
> revenue code 0900 for mental health visits. However, an additional AIR
> payment may be made for IPPE, DSMT or MNT (FQHCs only), and a
> subsequent illness and injuries billed with modifier 59 (FQHCs only).
>
> When reporting multiple services on FQHC claims, the 052X revenue line
> with the E&M HCPCS code must include the total charges for all of the
> services provided during the encounter, minus any charges for approved
> preventive services.
>
> For approved preventive services with a grade of A or B from the
> United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), the charges for
> these services must be deducted from the E&M HCPCS code for the
> purposes of calculating beneficiary coinsurance correctly. For
> example, if the total charge for the visit is \$350.00, and
>
> \$50.00 of that is for a qualified preventive service, the beneficiary
> coinsurance is based on \$300.00 of the total charge.
>
> For Example:

# - Payments for FQHC PPS Claims

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> Payment for FQHC PPS claims is made by comparing the adjusted FQHC PPS
> rate to the total submitted covered charges reported for the specific
> payment codes G0466, G0467, G0468, G0469, and G0470.

## To calculate payment, follow the steps below:

> Step 1: Determine the lesser of the provider's submitted charges for
> the specific payment code(s) and the fully-adjusted PPS rate.
>
> Step 2: Determine if preventive services for which the coinsurance is
> waived are present.
>
> Step 3: Subtract the charges for the preventive services from the
> lesser of the provider's charge for the specific payment code(s) or
> the PPS Rate.

## (Lesser of the provider's charge for the specific payment code or the PPS rate) - (Preventive services charges) = Step 3 total

> **Note:** If no preventive services are present, use the lesser of the
> providers charge for the specific payment code(s) or the PPS rate as
> the Step 3 total.
>
> Step 4: Multiply the total from Step 3 by 80%.

## Step 3 total \* 80% = Step 4 total

> **Note:** If no preventive services are present, contractors will pay
> this amount and skip step 5.
>
> Step 5: Add the charges for the approved preventive services to the
> total from step 4.
>
> Contractors will pay this amount.
>
> **Step 4 total + preventive services charges = Medicare Payment**
>
> **Note: If the charges for the approved preventive services are
> greater than the total payment amount identified in Step 1 (i.e., the
> lesser of the charges for the specific payment code or the PPS rate),
> pay 100% of the total payment amount determined in Step 1 and do not
> apply coinsurance. (Please see example 3)**
>
> **To calculate coinsurance, follow the steps below:**
>
> Step 1: Determine the lesser of the submitted charges for the G-code
> (s) and the PPS rate.
>
> Step 2: Determine if approved preventive services (i.e., preventive
> services for which coinsurance is waived) are present.
>
> Step 3: Subtract the charges for the preventive services from the
> lesser of the provider's charge for the specific payment code(s) or
> the PPS Rate.

## (Lesser of the provider's charge for the specific payment code or the PPS rate) - (Preventive services charges) = Step 3 total

> **Note:** If no approved preventive services are present, use the
> lesser the provider's charge for the specific payment code(s) or the
> PPS rate as the Step 3 total.
>
> Step 4: Multiply the total from Step 3 by 20%.

## Step 3 total \* 20% = Coinsurance

-   **Example: Payment based on the charges**

> PPS rate = 160.00
>
> Provider's actual charge for the specific payment code, G0467 = \$150

# - Billing for Supplemental Payments to FQHCs under Contract with Medicare Advantage (MA) Plans

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> Section 237 of the Medicare Modernization Act (MMA) requires CMS to
> provide supplemental payments to FQHCs that contract with MA
> organizations to cover the difference, if any, between the payment
> received by the FQHC for treating MA enrollees and the payment to
> which the FQHC would be entitled to receive under the cost-based
> all-inclusive payment rate as set forth in 42 CFR, Part 405, Subpart
> X.
>
> This supplemental payment for covered FQHC services furnished to MA
> enrollees augments the direct payments made by the MA organization to
> FQHCs for all covered FQHC services. The Medicare per diem payment,
> which continues to be made for all covered FQHC services furnished to
> Medicare beneficiaries participating in the original Medicare program,
> is based on the FQHC\'s unique cost-per-visit as calculated by the
> MAC. The MAC determines if the Medicare payments that the FQHC would
> be entitled to exceed the amount of payments received by the FQHC from
> the MA organization and, if so, pay the difference to the FQHC.
>
> FQHCs seeking the supplemental payment are required to submit (for the
> first two rate years) to the MAC an estimate of the average MA
> payments (per visit basis) for covered FQHC services. They are
> required to submit a documented estimate of their average per visit
> payment for their MA enrollees, for each MA plan they contract with,
> and any other information as may be required to enable the MAC to
> accurately establish an interim supplemental payment.
>
> Expected payments from the MA organization would only be used until
> actual MA revenue and visits collected on the FQHC's cost report can
> be used to establish the amount of the supplemental payment.
>
> Effective January 1, 2006, eligible FQHCs will report actual MA
> revenue and visits on their cost reports. At the end of each cost
> reporting period the MAC shall use actual MA revenue and visit data
> along with the FQHC's final all-inclusive payment rate, to determine
> the FQHC's final actual supplemental per visit payment. Once this
> amount (per visit basis) is determined it will serve as the interim
> rate for the next full rate year.
>
> Actual aggregated supplemental payments will then be reconciled with
> aggregated interim supplemental payments, and any underpayment or
> overpayment thereon will then be accounted for in determining final
> Medicare FQHC program liability at cost settlement.
>
> An FQHC is only eligible to receive this supplemental payment when
> FQHC services are provided during a face-to-face encounter between an
> MA enrollee and one or more of the following FQHC covered core
> practitioners: physicians, nurse practitioners, physician assistants,
> certified nurse midwives, clinical psychologists, or clinical social
> workers.
>
> The supplemental payment is made directly to each qualified FQHC
> through the MAC.
>
> Each FQHC seeking the supplemental payment is responsible for
> submitting a claim for each qualifying visit to the MAC on type of
> bill (TOB) 77x with revenue code 0519 for the amount of the interim
> supplemental payment rate (FQHC interim all-inclusive rate --
> estimated average payment from the MA plan plus any beneficiary cost
> sharing = billed amount \> 0). Do not submit revenue codes 052X and/or
> 0900 on the same claim as revenue code 0519.
>
> For services of plan years beginning on and after January 1, 2006 and
> before, an interim supplemental rate can be determined by the MAC
> based on cost report data, MACs shall calculate an interim
> supplemental payment for each MA plan the FQHC has contracted with
> using the documented estimate provided by the FQHC of their average MA
> payment (per visit basis) under each MA plan they contract with. Once
> an interim supplemental rate is determined for a previous plan year
> based on cost report data, use that interim rate until the MAC
> receives information that changes in service patterns that will result
> in a different interim rate. MACs shall calculate an interim
> supplemental payment rate for each MA plan the FQHC has contracted
> with. Reconcile all interim payments at cost settlement.
>
> Do not apply the Medicare deductible when calculating the FQHC interim
> supplemental payment. Do not apply the original Medicare co-insurance
> (20%) to the FQHC all inclusive rate when calculating the FQHC interim
> supplemental payment. Any beneficiary cost sharing under the MA plan
> is included in the calculation of the FQHC interim supplemental
> payment rate.
>
> MACs shall submit all claims to CWF for approval. CWF will verify each
> beneficiary's enrollment in an MA plan for the line item date of
> service (LIDOS) on the claim. CWF
>
> shall reject all claims for the FQHC interim supplemental payment for
> beneficiaries who are not MA enrollees on the same date as the LIDOS
> on the claim. MACs shall RTP such claims to the FQHCs. MACs shall
> accept TOB 77x with revenue code 0519 and pay the interim supplemental

# - PPS Payments to FQHCs under Contract with MA Plans

## (Rev. 3434, Issued: 12-31-15, Effective: 03-31-16, Implementation: 03-31-16)

> For claims with the 0519 revenue code, the wraparound payment is based
> on the PPS rate without comparison to the provider's charge. The rate
> is also NOT adjusted for coinsurance or preventive services as the MA
> plan would have already assessed any applicable coinsurance and

> When the MA contract rate is lower than the applicable PPS rate that
