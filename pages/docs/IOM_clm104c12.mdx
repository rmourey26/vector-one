# - Medicare Physicians Fee Schedule (MPFS)

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15000

> A/B MACs (B) pay for physicians' services furnished on or after
> January 1, 1992, on the basis of a fee schedule. The Medicare allowed
> charge for such physicians' services is the lower of the actual charge
> or the fee schedule amount. The Medicare payment is 80 percent of the
> allowed charge after the deductible is met.
>
> Chapter 23 provides a list of physicians' services payable based on
> the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS).

# - Method for Computing Fee Schedule Amount

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> **B3-15006**
>
> The CMS continually updates, refines, and alters the methods used in
> computing the fee schedule amount. For example, input from the
> American Academy of Ophthalmology has led to alterations in the
> supplies and equipment used in the computation of the fee schedule for
> selected procedures. Likewise, new research has changed the payments
> made for physical and occupational therapy. The CMS provides the
> updated fee schedules to A/B MACs (B) on an annual basis. The sections
> below introduce the formulas used for fee schedule computations.

### Formula

> The fully implemented resource-based MPFS amount for a given service
> can be computed by using the formula below:
>
> MPFS Amount = \[(RVUw x GPCIw) + (RVUpe x GPCIpe) + (RVUm x GPCIm)\] x
> CF
>
> Where:

RVUw equals a relative value for physician work, RVUpe equals a relative
value for practice expense, and RVUm refers to a relative value for
malpractice.

> In order to consider geographic differences in each payment locality,
> three geographic practice cost indices (GPCIs) are included in the
> core formula:

-   A GPCI for physician work (GPCIw),

-   A GPCI for practice expense (GPCIpe), and

-   A GPCI for malpractice (GPCIm).

> The above variables capture the efforts and productivity of the
> physician, his/her individualized costs for staff and for
> productivity-enhancing technology and materials. The applicable
> national conversion factor (CF) is then used in the computation of
> every MPFS amount.
>
> The national conversion factors are: 2002 - \$36.1992
>
> 2001 - \$38.2581
>
> 2000 - \$36.6137
>
> 1999 - \$34.7315
>
> 1998 - \$36.6873
>
> 1997 - \$40.9603 (Surgical); \$33.8454 (Nonsurgical); \$35.7671
> (Primary Care) 1996 - \$40.7986 (Surgical); \$34.6296 (Nonsurgical);
> \$35.4173 (Primary Care) 1995 - \$39.447 (Surgical); \$34.616
> (Nonsurgical); \$36.382 (Primary Care) 1994 - \$35.158 (Surgical);
> \$32.905 (Nonsurgical); \$33.718 (Primary Care) 1993 - \$31.926
> (Surgical); \$31,249 (Nonsurgical);
>
> 1992 - \$31.001
>
> For the years 1999 through 2002, payments attributable to practice
> expenses transitioned from charge-based amounts to resource-based
> practice expense RVUs. The CMS used the following transition formula
> to calculate the practice expense RVUs.
>
> 1999 - 75 percent of charged-based RVUs and 25 percent of the
> resource-based RVUs. 2000 - 50 percent of the charge-based RVUs and 50
> percent of the resource-based
>
> RVUs.
>
> 2001 - 25 percent of the charge-based RVUs and 75 percent of the
> resource-based RVUs.
>
> 2002 - 100 percent of the resource-based RVUs.
>
> As the tabular display introduced earlier indicates, CMS has
> calculated separate facility and nonfacility resource-based practice
> expense RVUs.

### Example of Computation of Fee Schedule Amount

> The following example further clarifies the computation of a fee
> schedule amount.

### Background Example

> Nationwide, cardiovascular disease has retained its position as a
> primary cause of morbidity and mortality. Currently, cardiovascular
> disease affects approximately 61.8 million Americans. Cardiovascular
> disease is responsible for over 40 percent of all deaths in the United
> States. However, 84.3 percent of those deaths are persons age 65 and
> above.
>
> Organ transplantation is one modality that has been used in the
> treatment of cardiovascular disease. Currently over 2,000 persons per
> year receive a heart transplant. However, another 2,300 persons are on
> the waiting list. Because of the disparity between the demand and
> supply of organs, mechanical heart valves are now covered under
> Medicare.

### Sample Computation of Fee Schedule

> Patients fitted with a mechanical heart valve require intensive home
> international normalized ratio (INR) monitoring by his/her physician.
> Physician services required may include instructions on demonstrations
> to the patient regarding the use and maintenance of the INR monitor,
> instructions regarding the use of a blood sample for reporting home
> INR test results, and full confirmation that the client can
> competently complete the required self-testing.

### Assumptions

> RVUw = 0
>
> Given the nature of the example, the physician would, under product
> code G0248, not be allowed to assign work RVUs.
>
> RVUm = .01
>
> However, the treatment of the patient with a mechanical heart carries
> a level of risk.
>
> RVUpe = 2.92
>
> Based upon a relatively intense level of staff time for an RN/LRN, or
> MN, as well as a supply list that includes a relatively sophisticated
> home INR monitor, batteries, educational materials, test strips and
> other materials, the RVUpe can be assigned a value of 2.92.
>
> The above values require modification by regionally based values for
> work, practice, and malpractice. If the city is assumed to be
> Birmingham, Alabama, the values below can be assigned based upon
> current data.
>
> GPCIw = 0.994
>
> GPCIpe = 0.912
>
> GPCIm = 0.927
>
> The above indices suggest that the index in Birmingham is .6 percent
> below the national norm for physician work intensity, 8.8 percent
> below the national norm for practice expenses, and
>
> 7.3 percent below the national norm for malpractice.
>
> If the assumption is made that the nonfacility payment for a home
> visit is \$166.52, the full fee schedule payment can be computed
> through substitution into the formula.
>
> Payment = (RVUw x GPCIw + (RVUpe x GPCIpe) + RVUm + GPCIm x physician
> fee schedule payment.
>
> Payment = (0 x .994) + (2.92 x .927) + (.01 x .912) x \$166.52 =
>
> Payment = (0) + (2.70684) + (.00912) x 166.52
>
> Payment = \$452.26166 or \$452.26 when rounded to the nearest cent.
>
> The above example is purely illustrative. The CMS completes all
> calculations and provides A/B MACs (B) with final fee schedules for
> each locality via the Medicare Physicians' Fee Schedule Database
> (MPFSDB). Localities used to pay services under the MPFS are listed in
> Chapter 23.

# - Relative Value Units (RVUs)

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Resource-based practice expenses relative value units (RVUs) comprise
> the core of physician fees paid under Medicare Part B payment
> policies. The CMS provides A/B MACs (B) with the fee schedule RVUs for
> all services except the following:
>
> Those with local codes;
>
> Those with national codes for which national relative values have not
> been established; Those requiring "By Report" payment or A/B MAC (B)
> pricing; and
>
> Those that are not included in the definition of physicians' services.
>
> For services with national codes but for which national relative
> values have not been provided, A/B MACs (B) must establish local
> relative values (to be multiplied, in the MCS system, by the national
> CF), as appropriate, or establish a flat local payment amount. A/B
> MACs (B) may choose between these options.
>
> The "By Report" services (with national codes or modifiers) include
> services with codes ending in 99, team surgery services, unusual
> services, pricing of the technical component for positron emission
> tomography reduced services, and radio nuclide codes A4641 and 79900.
> The status indicators of the Medicare fee schedule database identify
> these specific national codes and modifiers that A/B MACs (B) are to
> continue to pay on a "By Report" basis. A/B MACs (B) may not establish
> RVUs for them. Similarly, A/B MACs (B) may not establish RVUs for "By
> Report" services with local codes or modifiers.
>
> Additionally, A/B MACs (B) do not establish fees for noncovered
> services or for services always bundled into another service. The
> MPFSDB identifies noncovered national codes and codes that are always
> bundled.

### Diagnostic Procedures and Other Codes With Professional and Technical Components

> For diagnostic procedure codes and other codes describing services
> with both professional and technical components, relative values are
> provided for the global service, the professional component, and the
> technical component. The CMS makes the determination of which HCPCS
> codes fall into this category.

### No Special RVUs for Limited License Practitioners

> There are no special RVUs for limited license physicians, e.g.,
> optometrists and podiatrists. The fee schedule RVUs apply to a service
> regardless of whether a medical doctor, doctor of osteopathy, or
> limited license physician performs the service. A/B MACs (B) may not
> restrict either physicians, independently practicing physical
> therapists, and/or other providers of covered services by the use of
> these codes.

# - Bundled Services/Supplies

### (Rev. 147, 04-23-04)

> There are a number of services/supplies that are covered under
> Medicare and that have HCPCS codes, but they are services for which
> Medicare bundles payment into the payment for other related services.
> If A/B MACs (B) receive a claim that is solely for a service or supply
> that must be mandatorily bundled, the claim for payment should be
> denied by the A/B MAC (B).

### Routinely Bundled

> Separate payment is never made for routinely bundled services and
> supplies. The CMS has provided RVUs for many of the bundled
> services/supplies. However, the RVUs are not for
>
> Medicare payment use. A/B MACs (B) may not establish their own
> relative values for these services.

### Injection Services

> Injection services (codes 90782, 90783, 90784, 90788, and 90799)
> included in the fee schedule are not paid for separately if the
> physician is paid for any other physician fee schedule service
> rendered at the same time. A/B MACs (B) must pay separately for those
> injection services only if no other physician fee schedule service is
> being paid. In either case, the drug is separately payable. If, for
> example, code 99211 is billed with an injection service, pay only for
> code 99211 and the separately payable drug. (See section 30.6.7.D.)
> Injection services that are immunizations with hepatitis B,
> pneumococcal, and influenza vaccines are not included in the fee
> schedule and are paid under the drug pricing methodology as described
> in Chapter 17.

### Global Surgical Packages

> The MPFSDB lists the global charge period applicable to surgical
> procedures.

### Intra-Operative and/or Duplicate Procedures

> Chapter 23 and [§30]{.underline} of this chapter describe the correct
> coding initiative (CCI) and policies to detect improper coding and
> duplicate procedures.

### EKG Interpretations

> For services provided between January 1, 1992, and December 31, 1993,
> A/B MACs (B) must not make separate payment for EKG interpretations
> performed or ordered as part of, or in conjunction with, visit or
> consultation services. The EKG interpretation codes that are bundled
> in this way are 93000, 93010, 93040, and 93042. Virtually, all EKGs
> are performed as part of or ordered in conjunction with a visit,
> including a hospital visit.
>
> If the global code is billed for, i.e., codes 93000 or 93040, A/B MACs
> (B) should assume that the EKG interpretation was performed or ordered
> as part of a visit or consultation. Therefore, they make separate
> payment for the tracing only portion of the service, i.e., code 93005
> for 93000 and code 93041 for 93040. When the A/B MAC (B) makes this
> assumption in processing a claim, they include a message to that
> effect on the Medicare Summary Notice (MSN).
>
> For services provided on or after January 1, 1994, A/B MACs (B) make
> separate payment for an EKG interpretation.

# - Summary of Adjustments to Fee Schedule Computations

### (Rev. 1931, Issued: 03-12-10, Effective: 06-14-10, Implementation: 06-14-10)

> For services prior to January 1, 1994, A/B MACs (B) computed the fee
> schedule amount for every service. Through 1995, the fee schedule
> amount is the transition fee schedule amount. For services after 1995,
> CMS computes and provides the fee schedule amount for every service
> discussed above.
>
> Certain adjustments are made in order to arrive at the final fee
> schedule amount. Those adjustments are:

-   Participating versus nonparticipating differential;

-   Reduction for re-operations;

-   Site of service payment adjustment;

-   Multiple surgeries;

-   Bilateral surgery;

-   Anti-Markup Payment Limitation;

-   Provider providing less than global fee package;

-   Assistant at surgery;

-   Two surgeons/surgical team; and

-   Supplies.

    1.  # - Participating Versus Nonparticipating Differential

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15032

> For services/supplies rendered prior to January 1, 1994, the amounts
> allowed to nonparticipating physicians, under the fee schedule may not
> exceed 95 percent of the participating fee schedule amount. Payments
> to other entities under the fee schedule (physiological and
> independent laboratories, physical and occupational therapists,
> portable x- ray suppliers, etc.) are not subject to this differential
> unless the entities are billing for a physician's professional
> service. When a nonparticipating nonphysician is billing for a
> physician's professional service, Medicare's allowance could not
> exceed 95 percent of the fee schedule amount.
>
> For services/supplies rendered on or after January 1, 1994, payments
> to any nonparticipant may not exceed 95 percent of the fee schedule
> amount or other payment basis for the service/supply. This five
> percent reduction applies not only to nonparticipating physicians,
> physician assistants, nurse midwives, and clinical nurse specialists
> but also to entities such as nonparticipating portable x-ray
> suppliers, independently practicing physical and occupational
> therapists, audiologists, and other diagnostic facilities.
> Furthermore, these nonparticipating entities including physicians, are
> subject to the five percent reduction not only when they bill for
> services paid for under the physician fee schedule, but also when they
> bill for services that are legally billable under the physician fee
> schedule, but which are based upon alternative payment methodologies.
> As of January 1, 9994 and beyond, the services/supplies included in
> this latter category are drugs and biologicals provided incident to
> physicians services. The payment basis for these drugs and biologicals
> is the lower of the average wholesale price (AWP) or the estimated
> acquisition cost (EAC). Therefore, the Medicare payment allowance for
> "incident to" drugs and biologicals billed by and a nonparticipant
> cannot exceed 95 percent of whichever is lower than the AWP or the
> EAC.

# - Site of Service Payment Differential

### (Rev. 10356, Issued: 09-18-2020, Effective Date: 10-19-2020, Implementation Date: 10-19-

> **2020)**
>
> Under the Medicare Physician Fee schedule (MPFS), some procedures have
> separate rates for physicians' services when provided in facility and
> nonfacility settings. The CMS furnishes both rates in the MPFSDB
> update.
>
> The rate, facility or nonfacility, that a physician service is paid
> under the MPFS is determined by the Place of service (POS) code that
> is used to identify the setting where the beneficiary received the
> face-to-face encounter with the physician, nonphysician practitioner
> (NPP) or other supplier. In general, the POS code reflects the actual
> place where the beneficiary receives the face-to-face service and
> determines whether the facility or nonfacility payment rate is paid.
> However, for a service rendered to a patient who is an inpatient of a
> hospital (POS code 21) or an outpatient of a hospital (POS codes 19 or
> 22), the facility rate is paid, regardless of where the face-to-face
> encounter with the beneficiary occurred. For the professional
> component (PC) of diagnostic tests, the facility and nonfacility
> payment rates are the same -- irrespective of the POS code on the

# - Assistant-at Surgery-Services

### (Rev. 2656, Issuance: 02-07-13, Effective: 02-19-13, Implementation: 02-19-13)

> For assistant-at-surgery services performed by physicians, the fee

# - Supplies

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15900.2

> A/B MACs (B) make a separate payment for supplies furnished in
> connection with a procedure only when one of the two following
> conditions exists:

A.  HCPCS code A4300 is billed in conjunction with the appropriate
    procedure in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule Data Base (place of
    service is physician's office). However, A4550, A4300, and A4263 are
    no longer separately payable as of 2002. Supplies have been
    incorporated into the practice expense RVU for 2002. Thus, no
    payment may be made for these supplies for services provided on or
    after January 1, 2002.

B.  The supply is a pharmaceutical or radiopharmaceutical diagnostic
    imaging agent (including codes A4641 through A4647); pharmacologic
    stressing agent (code J1245); or therapeutic radionuclide (CPT code
    79900). Other agents may be used which do not have an assigned HCPCS
    code. The procedures performed are:

    -   Diagnostic radiologic procedures (including diagnostic nuclear
        medicine) requiring pharmaceutical or radiopharmaceutical
        contrast media and/or pharmacologic stressing agent;

    -   Other diagnostic tests requiring a pharmacologic stressing
        agent;

    -   Clinical brachytherapy procedures (other than remote
        after-loading high intensity brachytherapy procedures (CPT codes
        77781 through 77784) for which the expendable source is included
        in the TC RVUs); or

    -   Therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures.

> Drugs are not supplies, and may be paid incidental to physicians'
> services as described in Chapter 17.

# - Payment Due to Unusual Circumstances (Modifiers "-22" and "-52")

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15028

> The fees for services represent the average work effort and practice
> expenses required to provide a service. For any given procedure code,
> there could typically be a range of work effort or practice expense
> required to provide the service. Thus, A/B MACs (B) may increase or
> decrease the payment for a service only under very unusual
> circumstances based upon review of medical records and other

# -- Technical Component Payment Reduction for X-Rays and Other Imaging Services

### (Rev. 3820, Issued: 11-21-17, Effective: 01-01-18, Implementation; 01-02-18)

> Several provisions provide for a payment reduction to the technical
> component (and the technical component of the global fee) for X-rays

> 13, Section 20.2 of this publication for more information.

# - No Adjustments in Fee Schedule Amounts

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15054

> A/B MACs (B) may not make adjustments in fee schedule amounts provided
> by CMS for:

-   Inherent reasonableness;

-   Comparability;

-   Multiple visits to nursing homes (i.e., when more than one patient
    is seen during the same trip);

-   Refractions - If A/B MACs (B) receive a claim for a service that
    also indicates that a refraction was done, A/B MACs (B) do not
    reduce payment for the service. The CMS has already made the
    reduction in the fee for refractions provided to A/B MACs (B);

-   HCPCS alpha-numeric modifiers AT (acute treatment), ET (emergency
    treatment), LT (left side of body), RT (right side of body), and SF
    (second opinion ordered by PRO);

-   CPT modifiers -23 (unusual anesthesia), -32 (mandated services), -47
    (anesthesia by surgeon), -76 (repeat procedure by same physician),
    and -90 (reference laboratory); and

-   A/B MAC (B)-unique local modifiers (HCPCS Level 3 modifiers
    beginning with the letters w through z).

# 20.7 - Comparability of Payment Provision of Delegation of Authority by CMS to Railroad Retirement Board

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15064

> The delegation of authority, under which the Railroad Retirement Board
> (RRB) administers the Supplementary Medical Insurance Benefits Program
> for qualified railroad retirement beneficiaries, requires that:
>
> The Railroad Retirement Board shall take such action as may be
> necessary to assure that payments made for services by the A/B MACs
> (A) it selects will conform as closely as possible to the payment made
> for comparable services in the same locality by an A/B MAC (A) acting
> for CMS.
>
> The purpose of this comparability of payment is to reduce to the
> extent possible disparities between the payments made by the A/B MAC
> (B) under the RRB delegation and the payments made by the regular A/B
> MACs (B) for services or items furnished by the same physicians,
> including provider-based physicians, or suppliers. For all services
> paid for under the physician fee schedule, A/B MACs (B) under the RRB
> delegation pay based on the same fee schedule amount used by the A/B
> MAC (B).

# 20.8 - Payment for Teleradiology Physician Services Purchased by the Indian Health Service (IHS) Providers and Physicians

### (Rev. 1643, Issued: 12-05-08, Effective: 01-01-07, Implementation: 03-09-09)

> The IHS providers may choose to purchase or otherwise contract with
> non-IHS physicians or practitioners for teleradiology interpretations
> services. These services may be paid using either contractual
> reassignment or purchased test methodologies. See Chapter 19, §120 of
> this manual for further information.

# - Correct Coding Policy

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15068

> The Correct Coding Initiative was developed to promote national
> correct coding methodologies and to control improper coding leading to
> inappropriate payment in Part B claims. Refer to Chapter 23 for
> additional information on the initiative.
>
> The principles for the correct coding policy are:

-   The service represents the standard of care in accomplishing the
    overall procedure;

-   The service is necessary to successfully accomplish the
    comprehensive procedure. Failure to perform the service may
    compromise the success of the procedure; and

-   The service does not represent a separately identifiable procedure
    unrelated to the comprehensive procedure planned.

> For a detailed description of the correct coding policy, refer to
> [[http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/How-To-Use-NCCI-Tools.pdf)
> [[and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/How-To-Use-]{.underline}](http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/How-To-Use-NCCI-Tools.pdf)
> [[NCCI-Tools.pdf]{.underline}.](http://www.cms.gov/Outreach-and-Education/Medicare-Learning-Network-MLN/MLNProducts/downloads/How-To-Use-NCCI-Tools.pdf)
>
> The CMS as well as many third party payers have adopted the HCPCS/CPT
> coding system for use by physicians and others to describe services
> rendered. The system contains three levels of codes. Level I contains
> the American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology
> (CPT) numeric codes. Level II contains alpha-numeric codes primarily
> for items and services not included in CPT. Level III contains A/B MAC
> (B) specific codes that are not included in either Level I or Level
> II. For a list of CPT and HCPCS codes refer to the CMS Web site.
>
> The following general coding policies encompass coding principles that
> are to be applied in the review of Medicare claims. They are the basis
> for the correct coding edits that are installed in the claims
> processing systems effective January 1, 1996.

### Coding Based on Standards of Medical/Surgical Practice

> All services integral to accomplishing a procedure are considered
> bundled into that procedure and, therefore, are considered a component
> part of the comprehensive code. Many of these generic activities are
> common to virtually all procedures and, on other occasions, some are
> integral to only a certain group of procedures, but are still
> essential to accomplish these particular procedures. Accordingly, it
> is inappropriate to separately report these services based on standard
> medical and surgical principles.
>
> Because many services are unique to individual CPT coding sections,
> the rationale for rebundling is described in that particular section
> of the detailed coding narratives that are transmitted to A/B MACs (B)
> periodically.

### CPT Procedure Code Definition

> The format of the CPT manual includes descriptions of procedures,
> which are, in order to conserve space, not listed in their entirety
> for all procedures. The partial description is indented under the main
> entry. The main entry then encompasses the portion of the description
> preceding the semicolon. The main entry applies to and is a part of
> all indented entries, which follow with their codes.
>
> In the course of other procedure descriptions, the code definition
> specifies other procedures that are included in this comprehensive
> code. In addition, a code description may define a rebundling
> relationship where one code is a part of another based on the language
> used in the descriptor.

### CPT Coding Manual Instruction/Guideline

> Each of the six major subsections include guidelines that are unique
> to that section. These directions are not all inclusive of nor limited
> to, definitions of terms, modifiers, unlisted procedures or services,
> special or written reports, details about reporting separate, and
> multiple or starred procedures and qualifying circumstances.

### Coding Services Supplemental to Principal Procedure (Add-On Codes) Code

> Generally, these are identified with the statement "list separately in
> addition to code for primary procedure" in parentheses, and other
> times the supplemental code is used only with certain primary codes,
> which are parenthetically identified. The reason for these CPT codes
> is to enable physicians and others to separately identify a service
> that is performed in certain situations as an additional service.
> Incidental services that are necessary to accomplish the primary
> procedure (e.g., lysis of adhesions in the course of an open
> cholecystectomy) are not separately billed.

### Separate Procedures

> The narrative for many CPT codes includes a parenthetical statement
> that the procedure represents a "separate procedure."
>
> The inclusion of this statement indicates that the procedure, while
> possible to perform separately, is generally included in a more
> comprehensive procedure, and the service is not to be billed when a
> related, more comprehensive, service is performed. The "separate
> procedure" designation is used with codes in the surgery (CPT codes
> 10000-69999), radiology (CPT codes 70000-79999), and medicine (CPT
> codes 90000-99199) sections. When a related procedure
>
> from the same section, subsection, category, or subcategory is
> performed, a code with the designation of "separate procedure" is not
> to be billed with the primary procedure.

### Designation of Sex

> Many procedure codes have a sex designation within their narrative.
> These codes are not billed with codes having an opposite sex
> designation because this would reflect a conflict in sex
> classification either by the definition of the code descriptions
> themselves, or by the fact that the performance of these procedures on
> the same beneficiary would be anatomically impossible.

### Family of Codes

> In a family of codes, there are two or more component codes that are
> not billed separately because they are included in a more
> comprehensive code as members of the code family. Comprehensive codes
> include certain services that are separately identifiable by other
> component codes. The component codes as members of the comprehensive
> code family represent parts of the procedure that should not be listed
> separately when the complete procedure is done. However, the component
> codes are considered individually if performed independently of the
> complete procedure and if not all the services listed in the
> comprehensive codes were rendered to make up the total service.

### Most Extensive Procedures

> When procedures are performed together that are basically the same or
> performed on the same site but are qualified by an increased level of
> complexity, the less extensive procedure is bundled into the more
> extensive procedure.

### Sequential Procedures

> An initial approach to a procedure may be followed at the same
> encounter by a second, usually more invasive approach. There may be
> separate CPT codes describing each service. The second procedure is
> usually performed because the initial approach was unsuccessful in
> accomplishing the medically necessary service. These procedures are
> considered "sequential procedures." Only the CPT code for one of the
> services, generally the more invasive service, should be billed.

### With/Without Procedures

> In the CPT manual, there are various procedures that have been
> separated into two codes with the definitional difference being "with"
> versus "without" (e.g., with and without contrast).
>
> Both procedure codes cannot be billed. When done together, the
> "without" procedure is bundled into the "with" procedure.

### Laboratory Panels

> When components of a specific organ or disease oriented laboratory
> panel (e.g., codes 80061 and 80059) or automated multi-channel tests
> (e.g., codes 80002 - 80019) are billed separately, they must be
> bundled into the comprehensive panel or automated multi-channel test
> code as appropriate that includes the multiple component tests. The
> individual tests that make up a panel or can be performed on an
> automated multi-channel test analyzer are not to be separately billed.

### Mutually Exclusive Procedures

> There are numerous procedure codes that are not billed together
> because they are mutually exclusive of each other. Mutually exclusive
> codes are those codes that cannot reasonably be done in the same
> session.
>
> An example of a mutually exclusive situation is when the repair of the
> organ can be performed by two different methods. One repair method
> must be chosen to repair the organ and must be billed. Another example
> is the billing of an "initial" service and a "subsequent" service. It
> is
>
> contradictory for a service to be classified as an initial and a
> subsequent service at the same time.
>
> CPT codes which are mutually exclusive of one another based either on
> the CPT definition or the medical impossibility/improbability that the
> procedures could be performed at the same session can be identified as
> code pairs. These codes are not necessarily linked to one another with
> one code narrative describing a more comprehensive procedure compared
> to the component code, but can be identified as code pairs which
> should not be billed together.

### Use of Modifiers

> When certain component codes or mutually exclusive codes are
> appropriately furnished, such as later on the same day or on a
> different digit or limb, it is appropriate that these services be
> reported using a HCPCS code modifier. Such modifiers are modifiers
> E1 - E4, FA, F1 - F9, TA, T1 - T9, LT, RT, LC, LD, RC, -58, -78, -79,
> and -94.
>
> Modifier -59 is not appropriate to use with weekly radiation therapy
> management codes (77427) or with evaluation and management services
> codes (99201 - 99499).
>
> Application of these modifiers prevent erroneous denials of claims for
> several procedures performed on different anatomical sites, on
> different sides of the body, or at different sessions on the same date
> of service. The medical record must reflect that the modifier is being
> used appropriately to describe separate services.

# - Digestive System (Codes 40000 - 49999)

### (Rev. 3368, Issued: 10-09-15, Effective: 01-01-16, Implementation: 01-01-16)

A.  **Upper Gastrointestinal Endoscopy Including Endoscopic Ultrasound
    (EUS) (Code 43259)**

> If the person performing the original diagnostic endoscopy has access
> to the EUS and the clinical situation requires an EUS, the EUS may be
> done at the same time. The procedure, diagnostic and EUS, is reported
> under the same code, CPT 43259. This code conforms to CPT guidelines
> for the indented codes. The service represented by the indented code,
> in this case code 43259 for EUS, includes the service represented by
> the unintended code preceding the list of indented codes. Therefore,
> when a diagnostic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract
> "including esophagus, stomach, and either the duodenum or jejunum as
> appropriate," includes the use of endoscopic ultrasonography, the
> service is reported by a single code, namely 43259.
>
> Interpretation, whether by a radiologist or endoscopist, is reported
> under CPT code 76975-26. These codes may both be reported on the same
> day.

### Incomplete Colonoscopies (Codes 44388, 45378, G0105 and G0121)

> An incomplete colonoscopy, e.g., the inability to advance the
> colonoscope to the cecum or colon-small intestine anastomosis due to
> unforeseen circumstances, is billed and paid using colonoscopy through
> stoma code 44388, colonoscopy code 45378, and screening colonoscopy
> codes G0105 and G0121 with modifier "-53." (Code 44388 is valid with
> modifier 53 beginning January 1, 2016.) The Medicare physician fee
> schedule database has specific values for codes 44388-53, 45378-53,
> G0105-53 and G0121-53. An incomplete colonoscopy performed prior to
> January 1, 2016, is paid at the same rate as a sigmoidoscopy.
> Beginning January 1, 2016, Medicare will pay for the interrupted
> colonoscopy at a rate that is calculated using one-half the value of
> the inputs for the codes.

# - Urinary and Male Genital Systems (Codes 50010 - 55899)

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15200

A.  **Cystourethroscopy With Ureteral Catheterization (Code 52005)**

> Code 52005 has a zero in the bilateral field (payment adjustment for
> bilateral procedure does not apply) because the basic procedure is an
> examination of the bladder and urethra (cystourethroscopy), which are
> not paired organs. The work RVUs assigned take into account that it
> may be necessary to examine and catheterize one or both ureters. No
> additional payment is made when the procedure is billed with bilateral
> modifier "-50." Neither is any additional payment made when both
> ureters are examined and code 52005 is billed with multiple surgery
> modifier "-51." It is inappropriate to bill code 52005 twice, once by
> itself and once with modifier "-51," when both ureters are examined.

### Cystourethroscopy With Fulgration and/or Resection of Tumors (Codes 52234, 52235, and 52240)

> The descriptors for codes 52234 through 52240 include the language
> "tumor(s)."
>
> This means that regardless of the number of tumors removed, only one
> unit of a single code can be billed on a given date of service. It is
> inconsistent to allow payment for removal of a small (code 52234) and
> a large (code 52240) tumor using two codes when only one code is
> allowed for the removal of more than one large tumor. For these three
> codes only one unit may be billed for any of these codes, only one of
> the codes may be billed, and the billed code reflects the size of the
> largest tumor removed.

# - Audiology Services

### (Rev. 2044, Issued: 09-03-10, Effective: 09-30-10, Implementation: 09-30-10)

> Section 1861(ll)(3)of the Social Security Act (the Act) defines
> "audiology services" as such hearing and balance assessment services
> furnished by a qualified audiologist as the audiologist is legally
> authorized to perform under State law (or the State regulatory
> mechanism provided by State law), as would otherwise by covered if
> furnished by a physician. In this section, these hearing and balance
> assessment services are termed "audiology services," regardless of
> whether they are furnished by an audiologist, physician, nonphysician
> practitioner (NPP), or hospital.
>
> Because audiology services are diagnostic tests, when furnished in an
> office or hospital outpatient department, they must be furnished by or
> under the appropriate level of supervision of a physician as
> established in 42 CFR 410.32(b)(1) and 410.28(e). If not personally
> furnished by a physician, audiologist, or NPP, audiology services must
> be performed under direct physician supervision. As specified in 42
> CFR 410.32(b)(2)(ii) or (v), respectively, these services are excepted
> from physician supervision when they are personally furnished by a
> qualified audiologist or performed by a nurse practitioner or clinical
> nurse specialist authorized to perform the tests under applicable
> State laws.
>
> References to technicians apply also to other qualified clinical
> staff. See Pub. 100-02, chapter 15, section 80.3.D.

A.  ### Correct Reporting

    1.  General. Contact the A/B MAC (B) for guidance if the CPT
        codebook changes the description of codes mentioned in this
        section.

> Other policies concerning audiological services are found in Pub.
> 100-02, chapter 15, section 80.3.
>
> See chapter 26 of this manual for place of service and type of service
> coding.
>
> Section 4541(a)(2) of the Balanced Budget Act (BBA) (P.L. 105-33),
> which added section 1834(k)(5) to (the Act), required that all claims
> for certain audiology services be reported using a uniform coding
> system. CMS chose HCPCS (Healthcare Common Procedure Coding
>
> System) as the coding system for the reporting of these services. This
> coding requirement is effective for all claims for audiology services
> submitted on or after April 1, 1998.
>
> The BBA also required payment under a prospective payment system for
> audiology services. Effective for claims with dates of service on or
> after January 1, 1999, the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS)
> became the method of payment for audiology services furnished in the
> office setting and for the associated professional services furnished
> in physician's office and hospital outpatient settings.

2.  Use of the NPI. For audiologists who are enrolled and bill
    independently for services they render, the audiologist's NPI is
    required on all claims they submit. For example, in offices and
    private practice settings, an enrolled audiologist shall use his or
    her own NPI in the rendering loop to bill under the MPFS for the
    services the audiologist furnished. If an enrolled audiologist
    furnishing services to hospital outpatients reassigns his/her
    benefits to the hospital, the hospital may bill the A/B MAC (B) for
    the professional services of the audiologist under the MPFS using
    the NPI of the audiologist. If an audiologist is employed by a
    hospital but is not enrolled in Medicare, the only payment for a
    hospital outpatient audiology service that can be made is the
    payment to the hospital for its facility services under the hospital
    Outpatient Prospective Payment System (OPPS) or other applicable
    hospital payment system. No payment can be made under the MPFS for
    professional services of an audiologist who is not enrolled.

> they render in office settings on or after October 1, 2008 (for
> additional information about enrollment, refer to Pub. 100-08,
> Medicare Program Integrity Manual, chapter 15). Before October 1,

> Medicare were billed by a physician or group who employed the
> audiologist. Audiologists shall use the billing instructions in the

>
> Examples include, but are not limited to:

-   Comparison or consideration of the anatomical or physiological
    implications of test results or patient responsiveness to stimuli
    during the test;

-   Development and modification of the test battery and test protocols;

-   Clinical judgment, assessment, evaluation, and decision-making;

-   Interpretation and reporting observations, in addition to the
    objective data, that may influence interpretation of the test
    outcomes;

-   Tests related to implantation of auditory prosthetic devices,
    central auditory processing, contralateral masking; and/or

-   Tests to identify central auditory processing disorders, tinnitus,
    or nonorganic hearing loss.

> Audiology codes may be billed under the MPFS by audiologists,
> physicians, and NPPs using their own NPI in the rendering loop when
> those professionals personally furnish the test.
>
> Physicians and NPPs may not bill for these codes when an audiologist
> has furnished the service.

b.  [​Technician Skills.]{.underline}

> There may be subtests, or parts of a battery of tests, that may be
> appropriately furnished by an educated and experienced technician
> using a specific protocol under the direction of a supervising
> physician. These services are identified by A/B MAC (B) determination
> as services that do not require professional skills. They may be
> furnished by a qualified technician under the direct supervision of a
> physician, but not under the supervision of an audiologist or an NPP.
> The supervising physician is responsible for rendering and documenting
> all clinical judgment and for the appropriate provision of the service
> by the technician.
>
> A technician may not perform any part of a service that requires
> professional skills. A technician also may not perform a global
> service. For example, a technician may not interpret test results or
> engage in clinical decision-making.

c.  [​Professional Component (PC)/Technical Component (TC) Split
    Codes]{.underline}.

    -   The PC of a PC/TC split code may be billed by the audiologist,
        physician, or NPP who personally furnishes the service. (Note
        this is also true in the facility setting.) A physician or NPP
        may bill for the PC when the physician or NPP furnish the PC and
        an (unsupervised) audiologist furnishes and bills for the TC.
        The PC may not be billed if a technician furnishes the service.
        A physician or NPP may not bill for a PC service furnished by an
        audiologist.

    -   The TC of a PC/TC split code may be billed by the audiologist,
        physician, or NPP who personally furnishes the service.
        Physicians may bill the TC for services furnished by technicians
        when the technician furnishes the service under the direct
        supervision of that physician. Audiologists and NPPs may not
        bill for the TC of the service when a technician furnishes the
        service, even if the technician is supervised by the NPP or
        audiologist.

    -   The "global" service is billed when both the PC and TC of a
        service are personally furnished by the same audiologist,
        physician, or NPP. The global service may also be billed by a
        physician, but not an audiologist or NPP, when a technician
        furnishes the TC of the service under direct physician
        supervision and that physician furnishes the PC, including the
        interpretation and report.

d.  [Tests that are Not Described by Specific CPT Codes]{.underline}.
    Tests that have no appropriate CPT code may be reported under CPT
    code 92700 (Unlisted otorhinolaryngological service or procedure).

e.  [Tests that are]{.underline} A/B MAC (B)[-Priced.]{.underline} For
    codes valued by A/B MACs (B), the A/B MAC (B) determines whether and
    how much, if applicable, to pay for the service. The A/B MAC (B)
    sets the requirements for personnel furnishing the tests.

2.  [Billing for Audiology Services Furnished to Hospital
    Outpatients.]{.underline}

> All codes may be reported for audiology services furnished in the
> hospital outpatient setting and, in such cases, the code represents
> the facility service for the diagnostic test. All audiology services
> furnished to hospital outpatients must be billed and paid to the
> hospital under the OPPS or other applicable hospital payment system.
> The hospital bills its A/B MAC (A) and is paid for the facility
> resources required to furnish the services, regardless of whether the
> service is furnished by a physician, NPP, audiologist, or technician.
>
> Physicians, NPPs, and audiologists cannot bill and be paid for the TC
> of PC/TC split codes when these services are furnished to hospital
> outpatients. The associated professional services (represented by the
> PC or the CPT code for the audiology test which has no PC/TC split) of
> an
>
> enrolled audiologist, physician, or NPP who has reassigned benefits
> may be billed by the hospital to the A/B MAC (B), as appropriate.
> Alternatively, if the physician, NPP, or audiologist has not assigned
> benefits, the professional would bill his/her A/B MAC (B) for the
> professional services furnished.
>
> The appropriate revenue code for reporting audiology services is 0470
> (Audiology; General Classification). Providers are required to report
> a line-item date of service per revenue code line for audiology
> services.

3.  [Billing for Audiology Services Furnished to Skilled Nursing
    Facility (SNF) Patients.]{.underline}

> Payment for the facility resources (including the TC of PC/TC split
> codes) of audiology services provided to Part A inpatients of SNFs is
> included in the PPS rate. For SNFs, if the beneficiary has Part B but
> not Part A coverage (e.g., Part A benefits are exhausted), the SNF may
> elect to bill for audiology services but is not required to do so. As
> explained in Pub. 100- 04, chapter 7, section 40.1, since audiology
> services furnished during a noncovered SNF stay are not bundled with
> speech-language pathology services, payment can be made either to the
> SNF or to the audiology service provider/supplier.
>
> Audiologists, physicians, and NPPs enrolled in Medicare may bill
> directly for services rendered to Medicare beneficiaries who are in a
> SNF stay that is not covered by Part A but who have Part B
> eligibility. Payment is made based on the MPFS, whether on an
> institutional or professional claim. For beneficiaries in a noncovered
> SNF stay, audiology services are payable under Part B when billed by
> the SNF on an institutional claim as type of bill 22X, or when billed
> directly by the provider or supplier of the service (the audiologist,
> physician, or NPP who personally furnishes the test) on a professional
> claim. For PC/TC split codes, the SNF may elect to bill for the TC of
> the test on an institutional claim but is not required to bill for the
> service.

### Implant Processing

> Payment for diagnostic testing of implants, such as cochlear,
> osseointegrated or brainstem implants, including programming or
> reprogramming following implantation surgery is not included in the
> global fee for the surgery.
>
> The diagnostic analysis of a cochlear implant shall be billed using
> CPT codes 92601 through 92604.
>
> Osseointegrated prosthetic devices should be billed and paid for under
> provisions of the applicable payment system. For example, payment may
> differ depending upon whether the device is furnished on an inpatient
> or outpatient basis, and by a hospital subject to the OPPS, or by a
> Critical Access Hospital, physician's clinic, or a Federally Qualified
> Health Center.

### Aural Rehabilitation Services

> [General policy for evaluation and treatment of conditions related to
> the auditory system.]{.underline}
>
> For [evaluation]{.underline} of auditory processing disorders and
> speech-reading or lip-reading by a speech- language pathologist, use
> the untimed code 92506 with "1" as the unit of service, regardless of
> the duration of the service on a given day. This "always therapy"
> evaluation code must be provided by speech-language pathologists
> according to the policies in Pub. 100-02, chapter 15, sections 220 and
> 230. The codes 92620 and 92621 are diagnostic audiological tests and
> may not be used for SLP services.
>
> For [treatmen]{.underline}t of auditory processing disorders or
> auditory rehabilitation/auditory training (including speech-reading or
> lip-reading), 92507, and 92508 are used to report a single encounter

>
> For [evaluation]{.underline} of auditory rehabilitation to instruct
> the use of residual hearing provided by an implant or hearing aid
> related to hearing loss, the timed codes 92626 and 92627 are used.
>
> These are not "always therapy" codes. Evaluation of auditory

> audiologist or speech-language pathologist. Also, these services may
> be provided incident to a physician's or qualified NPP's service by a
> speech-language pathologist, or personally by a physician or qualified
> NPP within their scope of practice. Evaluation of auditory
> rehabilitation is a covered diagnostic test when performed and billed
> by an audiologist and is an SLP evaluation service covered under the
> SLP benefit when performed by a speech-language pathologist.
>
> General policies for post implant services.
>
> The services of a speech-language pathologist may be covered for SLP
> services provided after implantation of auditory devices. For example,
> a speech-language pathologist may provide evaluation and treatment of
> speech, language, cognition, voice, and auditory processing using code
> 92506 and 92507. Use 92626 and 92627 for auditory (aural)
> rehabilitation evaluation following cochlear implantation or for other
> hearing impairments.
>
> For diagnostic testing of cochlear implants, audiologists use codes
> 92601, 92602, 92603 and 92604. These services may not be provided by

### Electronic Analyses of Implantable Cardioverter-defibrillators and Pacemakers

> The CPT codes 93731, 93734, 93741 and 93743 are used to report
> electronic analyses of single or dual chamber pacemakers and single or
> dual chamber implantable cardioverter- defibrillators. In the office,
> a physician uses a device called a programmer to obtain information
> about the status and performance of the device and to evaluate the
> patient's cardiac rhythm and response to the implanted device.
>
> Advances in information technology now enable physicians to evaluate
> patients with implanted cardiac devices without requiring the patient
> to be present in the physician's office. Using a manufacturer's
> specific monitor/transmitter, a patient can send complete device data
> and specific cardiac data to a distant receiving station or secure
> Internet server. The electronic analysis of cardiac device data that
> is remotely obtained provides immediate and long-term data on the
> device and clinical data on the patient's cardiac functioning
> equivalent to that obtained during an in-office evaluation. Physicians
> should report the electronic analysis of an implanted cardiac device
> using remotely obtained data as described above with CPT code 93731,
> 93734, 93741 or 93743, depending on the type of cardiac device
> implanted in the patient.

# - Payment for Codes for Chemotherapy Administration and Nonchemotherapy Injections and Infusions

### (Rev. 968. Issued: 05-26-06; Effective/Implementation Dates: 06-26-06)

A.  **General**

> Codes for Chemotherapy administration and nonchemotherapy injections
> and infusions include the following three categories of codes in the
> American Medical Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT):

1.  Hydration;

2.  Therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic injections and infusions
    (excluding chemotherapy); and

3.  Chemotherapy administration.

> Physician work related to hydration, injection, and infusion services
> involves the affirmation of the treatment plan and the supervision
> (pursuant to incident to requirements) of nonphysician clinical staff.

### Hydration

> The hydration codes are used to report a hydration IV infusion which
> consists of a pre- packaged fluid and /or electrolytes (e.g. normal
> saline, D5-1/2 normal saline +30 mg EqKC1/liter) but are not used to
> report infusion of drugs or other substances.

### Therapeutic, prophylactic, and diagnostic injections and infusions (excluding chemotherapy)

> A therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic IV infusion or injection,
> other than hydration, is for the administration of substances/drugs.
> The fluid used to administer the drug (s) is incidental hydration and
> is not separately payable.
>
> If performed to facilitate the infusion or injection or hydration, the
> following services and items are included and are not separately
> billable:

1.  Use of local anesthesia;

2.  IV start;

3.  Access to indwelling IV, subcutaneous catheter or port;

4.  Flush at conclusion of infusion; and

5.  Standard tubing, syringes and supplies.

> Payment for the above is included in the payment for the chemotherapy
> administration or nonchemotherapy injection and infusion service.
>
> If a significant separately identifiable evaluation and management
> service is performed, the appropriate E & M code should be reported
> utilizing modifier 25 in addition to the chemotherapy administration
> or nonchemotherapy injection and infusion service. For an evaluation
> and management service provided on the same day, a different diagnosis
> is not required.
>
> The CPT 2006 includes a parenthetical remark immediately following CPT
> code 90772 (Therapeutic, prophylactic or diagnostic injection;
> (specify substance or drug); subcutaneous or intramuscular.) It
> states, "Do not report 90772 for injections given without direct
> supervision. To report, use 99211."
>
> This coding guideline does not apply to Medicare patients. If the RN,
> LPN or other auxiliary personnel furnishes the injection in the office
> and the physician is not present in the office to meet the supervision
> requirement, which is one of the requirements for coverage of an
> incident to service, then the injection is not covered. The physician
> would also not report 99211 as this would not be covered as an
> incident to service.

### Chemotherapy Administration

> Chemotherapy administration codes apply to parenteral administration
> of non-radionuclide anti-neoplastic drugs; and also to anti-neoplastic
> agents provided for treatment of noncancer
>
> diagnoses (e.g., cyclophosphamide for auto-immune conditions) or to
> substances such as monoclonal antibody agents, and other biologic
> response modifiers. The following drugs are commonly considered to
> fall under the category of monoclonal antibodies: infliximab,
> rituximab, alemtuzumb, gemtuzumab, and trastuzumab. Drugs commonly
> considered to fall under the category of hormonal antineoplastics
> include leuprolide acetate and goserelin acetate. The drugs cited are
> not intended to be a complete list of drugs that may be administered
> using the chemotherapy administration codes. A/B MACs (B) may provide
> additional guidance as to which drugs may be considered to be
> chemotherapy drugs under Medicare.
>
> The administration of anti-anemia drugs and anti-emetic drugs by
> injection or infusion for cancer patients is not considered
> chemotherapy administration.
>
> If performed to facilitate the chemotherapy infusion or injection, the
> following services and items are included and are not separately
> billable:

1.  Use of local anesthesia;

2.  IV access;

3.  Access to indwelling IV, subcutaneous catheter or port;

4.  Flush at conclusion of infusion;

5.  Standard tubing, syringes and supplies; and

6.  Preparation of chemotherapy agent(s).

> Payment for the above is included in the payment for the chemotherapy
> administration service.
>
> If a significant separately identifiable evaluation and management
> service is performed, the appropriate E & M code should be reported
> utilizing modifier 25 in addition to the chemotherapy code. For an
> evaluation and management service provided on the same day, a
> different diagnosis is not required.

### Coding Rules for Chemotherapy Administration and Nonchemotherapy Injections and Infusion Services

> Instruct physicians to follow the CPT coding instructions to report
> chemotherapy administration and nonchemotherapy injections and
> infusion services with the exception listed in subsection C for CPT
> code 90772. The physician should be aware of the following specific
> rules.
>
> When administering multiple infusions, injections or combinations, the
> physician should report only one "initial" service code unless
> protocol requires that two separate IV sites must be used. The initial
> code is the code that best describes the key or primary reason for the
> encounter and should always be reported irrespective of the order in
> which the infusions or injections occur. If an injection or infusion
> is of a subsequent or concurrent nature, even if it is the first such
> service within that group of services, then a subsequent or concurrent
> code should be reported. For example, the first IV push given
> subsequent to an initial one-hour infusion is reported using a
> subsequent IV push code.
>
> If more than one "initial" service code is billed per day, the A/B MAC
> (B) shall deny the second initial service code unless the patient has
> to come back for a separately identifiable service on the same day or
> has two IV lines per protocol. For these separately identifiable
> services, instruct the physician to report with modifier 59.
>
> The CPT includes a code for a concurrent infusion in addition to an
> intravenous infusion for therapy, prophylaxis or diagnosis. Allow only
> one concurrent infusion per patient per encounter. Do not allow
> payment for the concurrent infusion billed with modifier 59 unless it
> is provided during a second encounter on the same day with the patient
> and is documented in the medical record.
>
> For chemotherapy administration and therapeutic, prophylactic and
> diagnostic injections and infusions, an intravenous or intra-arterial
> push is defined as: 1.) an injection in which the healthcare
> professional is continuously present to administer the substance/drug
> and observe the patient; or 2.) an infusion of 15 minutes or less.
>
> The physician may report the infusion code for "each additional hour"
> only if the infusion interval is greater than 30 minutes beyond the 1
> hour increment. For example if the patient receives an infusion of a
> single drug that lasts 1 hour and 45 minutes, the physician would
> report the "initial" code up to 1 hour and the add-on code for the
> additional 45 minutes.
>
> Several chemotherapy administration and nonchemotherapy injection and
> infusion service codes have the following parenthetical descriptor
> included as a part of the CPT code, "List separately in addition to
> code for primary procedure." Each of these codes has a physician fee
> schedule indicator of "ZZZ" meaning this service is allowed if billed
> with another chemotherapy administration or nonchemotherapy injection
> and infusion service code.
>
> Do not interpret this parenthetical descriptor to mean that the add-on
> code can be billed only if it is listed with another drug
> administration primary code. For example, code 90761 will be
> ordinarily billed with code 90760. However, there may be instances
> when only the add-on code, 90761, is billed because an "initial" code
> from another section in the drug administration codes, instead of
> 90760, is billed as the primary code.
>
> Pay for code 96523, "Irrigation of implanted venous access device for
> drug delivery systems," if it is the only service provided that day.
> If there is a visit or other chemotherapy administration or
> nonchemotherapy injection or infusion service provided on the same
> day, payment for 96523 is included in the payment for the other
> service.

### Chemotherapy Administration (or Nonchemotherapy Injection and Infusion) and Evaluation and Management Services Furnished on the Same Day

> For services furnished on or after January 1, 2004, do not allow
> payment for CPT code 99211, with or without modifier 25, if it is
> billed with a nonchemotherapy drug infusion code or a chemotherapy
> administration code. Apply this policy to code 99211 when it is billed
> with a diagnostic or therapeutic injection code on or after January 1,
> 2005.
>
> Physicians providing a chemotherapy administration service or a
> nonchemotherapy drug infusion service and evaluation and management
> services, other than CPT code 99211, on the same day must bill in
> accordance with §30.6.6 using modifier 25. The A/B MACs (B) pay for
> evaluation and management services provided on the same day as the
> chemotherapy administration services or a nonchemotherapy injection or
> infusion service if the evaluation and management service meets the
> requirements of section §30.6.6 even though the underlying codes do
> not have global periods. If a chemotherapy service and a significant
> separately identifiable evaluation and management service are provided
> on the same day, a different diagnosis is not required.
>
> In 2005, the Medicare physician fee schedule status database
> indicators for therapeutic and diagnostic injections were changed from
> T to A. Thus, beginning in 2005, the policy on evaluation and
> management services, other than 99211, that is applicable to a
> chemotherapy or a nonchemotherapy injection or infusion service
> applies equally to these codes.

# - Selection of Level of Evaluation and Management Service

> ***(Rev .11842; Issued; 02-09-23 Effective:01-01-23; Implementation:
> 05-09-23)***

### General Rules

> Advise physicians to *generally* use CPT codes (level 1 of HCPCS) to
> code physician services, including evaluation and management *(E/M)*
> services. *Medicare has created Medicare- specific codes that must be
> used to report prolonged E/M services and E/M visit complexity add-on
> services.*
>
> Medicare will pay for E/M services for specific*,* non-physician
> practitioners (i.e., nurse practitioner (NP), clinical nurse
> specialist (CNS), and certified nurse midwife (CNM))*,* whose Medicare
> benefit permits them to bill these services. A physician assistant
> (PA) may also provide a physician service*;* however, the physician
> collaboration and general supervision rules as well as all billing
> rules apply to all the above non-physician practitioners. The service
> provided must be medically necessary*,* and the service must be within
> the scope of practice for a non-physician practitioner in the State in
> which he/she practices. Do not pay for CPT evaluation and management
> codes billed by physical therapists in independent practice or by
> occupational therapists in independent practice.
>
> The service should be documented during, or as soon as practicable
> after it is provided in order to maintain an accurate medical record.

### Selection of Level of Evaluation and Management Service

> *As of January 1, 2023, for most E/M visit families, practitioners
> will select visit level based on the level of medical decision making
> (MDM) or the amount of time spent by the physician or non-physician
> practitioner. For some types of visits (such as emergency department
> visits and critical care), in accordance with their CPT codes,
> practitioners do not have this choice and will use only MDM or only
> time to bill. The CPT E/M Guidelines for MDM apply. For all E/M
> visits, history and physical exam must be performed in accordance with
> code descriptors, but history and exam no longer impact visit level
> selection. When practitioner time is used to select visit level, the
> full time must be completed; the general CPT rule regarding the
> midpoint for certain timed services does not apply.*
>
> *Medical necessity of a service is the overarching criterion for
> payment in addition to the individual requirements of an E/M visit
> code. It would not be medically necessary or appropriate to bill a
> higher level of E/M service when a lower level of service is
> warranted. The volume of documentation should not be the primary
> influence upon which a specific level of service is billed.
> Documentation should support the level of service reported.*
>
> Any physician or non-physician practitioner (NPP) authorized to bill
> Medicare services will be paid by the Medicare Administrative
> Contractor (MAC) at the appropriate physician fee schedule amount
> based on the rendering national provider identifier (NPI) number.
>
> \"Incident to\" Medicare Part B payment policy is applicable for
> office visits when the requirements for \"incident to\" are met (refer
> to sections 60.1, 60.2, and 60.3, chapter 15 in IOM 100-02).

### SPLIT/SHARED E/M SERVICE

> See section 30.6.18 for rules regarding billing of E/M visits that are
> split (or shared).

    or are underway for the individual, as that list was developed at
    the first AWV providing PPPS, or the previous subsequent AWV
    providing PPPS,

-   Furnishing of personalized health advice to the individual and a
    referral, as appropriate, to health education or preventive
    counseling services or programs, and,

### Who May Perform an IPPE or AWV

> The A/B MAC (B) pays the appropriate physician fee schedule amount
> based on the rendering National Provider Identification (NPI) number.
>
> The IPPE may be performed by:

-   a doctor of medicine or osteopathy as defined in Section 1861(r) (1)
    of the Social Security Act, or

-   a qualified nonphysician practitioner (nurse practitioner, physician
    assistant or clinical nurse specialist).

> The AWV may be performed by a health professional, which is defined
> as:

-   a doctor of medicine or osteopathy as defined in Section 1861(r)(1)
    of the Social Security Act,

> a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or clinical nurse
> specialist (as defined in section 1861(aa)(5) of the Social Security
> Act), or

-   a medical professional (including a health educator, registered
    dietitian, nutrition professional, or other licensed practitioner)
    or a team of such medical professionals, working under the direct

C.  ### Eligibility

    1.  **IPPE**

> Medicare pays for one IPPE per beneficiary per lifetime for
> beneficiaries within the first 12 months of the effective date of the
> beneficiary's first Part B coverage period.

### AWV

> Medicare pays for an AWV for a beneficiary who is no longer within 12
> months after the effective date of his/her first Medicare Part B
> coverage period, and who has not received either an IPPE or an AWV
> providing PPPS within the past 12 months. Medicare pays for only one
> first AWV (HCPCS G0438), per beneficiary per lifetime. All subsequent
> AWVs must be billed using HCPCS G0439.

D.  ### Deductible and Coinsurance

    1.  **IPPE**

> The Medicare deductible and coinsurance apply for the IPPE provided
> before January 1, 2009.
>
> The Medicare deductible is waived effective for the IPPE provided on
> or after January 1, 2009. However, the applicable coinsurance
> continues to apply for the IPPE provided on or after January 1, 2009.
>
> As a result of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), effective for the IPPE
> provided on or after January 1, 2011, the Medicare deductible and
> coinsurance (for HCPCS code G0402 only) are waived.

### AWV

> As a result of the ACA, effective January 1, 2011, the Medicare
> deductible and coinsurance for the AWV (HCPCS G0438 and G0439) are
> waived.

### The EKG Component of the IPPE

> The once-in-a-lifetime screening EKG may be performed, as appropriate,
> with a referral from an IPPE.

F.  ### HCPCS Codes Used to Bill the IPPE or AWV

    1.  **HCPCS Codes Used to Bill the IPPE**

> For IPPE and EKG services provided prior to January 1, 2009, the
> physician or qualified NPP shall bill HCPCS code G0344 for the IPPE
> performed face-to-face, and HCPCS code G0366 for performing a
> screening EKG that includes both the interpretation and report. If the
> primary physician or qualified NPP performs only the IPPE, he/she
> shall bill HCPCS code G0344 only. The physician or entity that
> performs the screening EKG that includes both the interpretation and
> report shall bill HCPCS code G0366. The physician or entity that
> performs the screening EKG tracing only (without interpretation and
> report) shall bill HCPCS code G0367. The physician or entity that
> performs the interpretation and report only (without the EKG tracing)
> shall bill HCPCS code G0368. Medicare will pay for a screening EKG
> only as part of the IPPE. HCPCS codes G0344, G0366, G0367 and G0368
> will not be billable codes effective on or after January 1, 2009.
>
> Effective for a beneficiary who has the IPPE on or after January 1,
> 2009, and within his/her 12- month enrollment period of Medicare Part
> B, the IPPE and screening EKG services are billable with the
> appropriate HCPCS G code(s).
>
> The physician or qualified NPP shall bill HCPCS code G0402 for the
> IPPE performed face-to- face with the patient.
>
> The physician or entity shall bill HCPCS code G0403 for performing the
> complete screening EKG that includes the tracing, interpretation and
> report.
>
> The physician or entity that performs the screening EKG tracing only
> (without interpretation and report) shall bill HCPCS code G0404.
>
> The physician or entity that performs the screening EKG interpretation
> and report only, (without the EKG tracing) shall bill HCPCS code
> G0405.

### HCPCS Codes Used to Bill the AWV

> For the first AWV provided on or after January 1, 2011, the health
> professional shall bill HCPCS G0438 (Annual wellness visit, including
> PPPS, first visit). This is a once per beneficiary per lifetime
> allowable Medicare Part B benefit.
>
> All subsequent AWVs shall be billed with HCPCS G0439 (Annual Wellness
> Visit, including PPPS, subsequent visit). In the event that a
> beneficiary selects a new health professional to complete a subsequent
> AWV, the new health professional will continue to bill the subsequent
> AWV with HCPCS G0439.
>
> **NOTE:** For an IPPE or AWV performed during the global period of
> surgery, refer to chapter 12, §30.6.6 of this chapter for reporting
> instructions.

### Documentation for the IPPE or AWV

> Practitioners eligible to furnish an IPPE or an AWV are required to
> use the 1995 and 1997 E/M documentation guidelines to document the
> medical record with the appropriate clinical information.
> ([http://xmarks.com/site/www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNEdWebGuide/25_EMDOC.asp).](http://xmarks.com/site/www.cms.hhs.gov/MLNEdWebGuide/25_EMDOC.asp))
> All referrals and a written medical plan must be included in this
> documentation.

### Reporting a Medically Necessary E/M Service Furnished During the Same Encounter as an IPPE or AWV

> When the physician or qualified NPP, or for AWV the health
> professional, provides a significant, separately identifiable
> medically necessary E/M service in addition to the IPPE or an AWV, CPT
> codes 99201 - 99215 may be reported depending on the clinical
> appropriateness of the circumstances. CPT Modifier -25 shall be
> appended to the medically necessary E/M service identifying this
> service as a significant, separately identifiable service from the
> IPPE or AWV code reported (HCPCS code G0344 or G0402, whichever
> applies based on the date the IPPE is performed, or HCPCS code G0438
> or G0439 whichever AWV code applies).
>
> **NOTE:** Some of the components of a medically necessary E/M service
> (e.g., a portion of history or physical exam portion) may have been
> part of the IPPE or AWV and should not be included when determining
> the most appropriate level of E/M service to be billed for the
> medically necessary, separately identifiable, E/M service.

# - Billing for Medically Necessary Visit on Same Occasion as Preventive Medicine Service

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> See Chapter 18 for payment for covered preventive services.
>
> When a physician furnishes a Medicare beneficiary a covered visit at
> the same place and on the same occasion as a noncovered preventive
> medicine service (CPT codes 99381-99397), consider the covered visit
> to be provided in lieu of a part of the preventive medicine service of
> equal value to the visit. A preventive medicine service (CPT codes
> 99381-99397) is a noncovered service. The physician may charge the
> beneficiary, as a charge for the noncovered remainder of the service,
> the amount by which the physician's current established charge for the
> preventive medicine service exceeds his/her current established charge
> for the covered visit. Pay for the covered visit based on the lesser
> of the fee schedule amount or the physician's actual charge for the
> visit. The physician is not required to give the beneficiary written
> advance notice of noncoverage of the part of the visit that
> constitutes a routine preventive visit. However, the physician is
> responsible for notifying the patient in advance of his/her liability
> for the charges for services that are not medically necessary to treat
> the illness or injury.
>
> There could be covered and noncovered procedures performed during this
> encounter (e.g., screening x-ray, EKG, lab tests.). These are
> considered individually. Those procedures which are for screening for
> asymptomatic conditions are considered noncovered and, therefore, no
>
> payment is made. Those procedures ordered to diagnose or monitor a
> symptom, medical condition, or treatment are evaluated for medical
> necessity and, if covered, are paid.

# - Payment for Immunosuppressive Therapy Management

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-4820-4824

> Physicians bill for management of immunosuppressive therapy using the
> office or subsequent hospital visit codes that describe the services
> furnished. If the physician who is managing the immunotherapy is also
> the transplant surgeon, he or she bills these visits with modifier
> "-24" indicating that the visit during the global period is not
> related to the original procedure if the physician also performed the
> transplant surgery and submits documentation that shows that the visit
> is for immunosuppressive therapy.

# - Evaluation and Management (E/M) Services Furnished Incident to Physician's Service by Nonphysician Practitioners

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> When evaluation and management services are furnished incident to a
> physician's service by a nonphysician practitioner, the physician may
> bill the CPT code that describes the evaluation and management service
> furnished.
>
> When evaluation and management services are furnished incident to a
> physician's service by a nonphysician employee of the physician, not
> as part of a physician service, the physician bills code 99211 for the
> service.
>
> A physician is not precluded from billing under the "incident to"
> provision for services provided by employees whose services cannot be
> paid for directly under the Medicare program. Employees of the
> physician may provide services incident to the physician's service,
> but the physician alone is permitted to bill Medicare.
>
> Services provided by employees as "incident to" are covered when they
> meet all the requirements for incident to and are medically necessary
> for the individual needs of the patient.

# - Physicians in Group Practice

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> Physicians in the same group practice who are in the same specialty
> must bill and be paid as though they were a single physician. If more
> than one evaluation and management (face-to- face) service is provided
> on the same day to the same patient by the same physician or more than
> one physician in the same specialty in the same group, only one
> evaluation and management service may be reported unless the
> evaluation and management services are for unrelated problems. Instead
> of billing separately, the physicians should select a level of service
> representative of the combined visits and submit the appropriate code
> for that level.
>
> Physicians in the same group practice but who are in different
> specialties may bill and be paid without regard to their membership in
> the same group.

# - Payment for Evaluation and Management Services Provided During Global Period of Surgery

### (Rev. 954, Issued: 05-19-06, Effective: 06-01-06, Implementation: 08-20-06)

A.  **CPT Modifier "-24" - Unrelated Evaluation and Management Service
    by Same Physician During Postoperative Period**

> A/B MACs (B) pay for an evaluation and management service other than
> inpatient hospital care before discharge from the hospital following
> surgery (CPT codes 99221-99238) if it was provided during the
> postoperative period of a surgical procedure, furnished by the same
> physician who performed the procedure, billed with CPT modifier "-24,"
> and accompanied by
>
> documentation that supports that the service is not related to the
> postoperative care of the procedure. They do not pay for inpatient
> hospital care that is furnished during the hospital stay in which the
> surgery occurred unless the doctor is also treating another medical
> condition that is unrelated to the surgery. All care provided during
> the inpatient stay in which the surgery occurred is compensated
> through the global surgical payment.

### CPT Modifier "-25" - Significant Evaluation and Management Service by Same Physician on Date of Global Procedure

> Medicare requires that Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) modifier
> -25 should only be used on claims for evaluation and management (E/M)
> services, and only when these services are provided by the same
> physician (or same qualified nonphysician practitioner) to the same
> patient on the same day as another procedure or other service. A/B
> MACs (B) pay for an E/M service provided on the day of a procedure
> with a global fee period if the physician indicates that the service
> is for a significant, separately identifiable E/M service that is
> above and beyond the usual pre- and post-operative work of the
> procedure. Different diagnoses are not required for reporting the E/M
> service on the same date as the procedure or other service. Modifier
> -25 is added to the E/M code on the claim.
>
> Both the medically necessary E/M service and the procedure must be
> appropriately and sufficiently documented by the physician or
> qualified nonphysician practitioner in the patient's medical record to
> support the claim for these services, even though the documentation is
> not required to be submitted with the claim.
>
> If the physician bills the service with the CPT modifier "-25," A/B
> MACs (B) pay for the service in addition to the global fee without any
> other requirement for documentation unless one of the following
> conditions is met:

-   When inpatient dialysis services are billed (CPT codes 90935, 90945,
    > 90947, and 93937), the physician must document that the service
    > was unrelated to the dialysis and could not be performed during
    > the dialysis procedure;

-   When preoperative critical care codes are being billed on the date
    > of the procedure, the diagnosis must support that the service is
    > unrelated to the performance of the procedure; or

-   When an A/B MAC (B) has conducted a specific medical review process
    > and determined, after reviewing the data, that an individual or a
    > group has high use of modifier "-25" compared to other physicians,
    > has done a case-by-case review of the records to verify that the
    > use of modifier was inappropriate, and has educated the individual
    > or group, the A/B MAC (B) may impose prepayment screens or
    > documentation requirements for that provider or group. When a A/B
    > MAC (B) has completed a review and determined that a high usage
    > rate of modifier "-57," the A/B MAC (B) must complete a
    > case-by-case review of the records. Based upon this review, the
    > A/B MAC (B) will educate providers regarding the appropriate use
    > of modifier "-57." If high usage rates continue, the A/B MAC (B)
    > may impose prepayment screens or documentation requirements for
    > that provider or group.

> A/B MACs (B) may not permit the use of CPT modifier "-25" to generate
> payment for multiple evaluation and management services on the same
> day by the same physician, notwithstanding the CPT definition of the
> modifier.

### CPT Modifier "-57" - Decision for Surgery Made Within Global Surgical Period

> A/B MACs (B) pay for an evaluation and management service on the day
> of or on the day before a procedure with a 90-day global surgical
> period if the physician uses CPT modifier
>
> "-57" to indicate that the service resulted in the decision to perform
> the procedure. A/B MACs
>
> \(B\) may not pay for an evaluation and management service billed with
> the CPT modifier "-57" if it was provided on the day of or the day
> before a procedure with a 0 or 10-day global surgical period.

# - Payment for Office or Other Outpatient Evaluation and Management (E/M) Visits (Codes 9920*2* - 99215)

> ***(Rev. 11842; Issued; 02-09-23 Effective:01-01-23; Implementation:
> 05-09-23)***

### Definition of New Patient for Selection of E/M Visit Code

> Interpret the phrase "new patient" to mean a patient who has not
> received any professional services, i.e., E/M service or other
> face-to-face service (e.g., surgical procedure) from the physician or
> physician group practice (same physician specialty) within the
> previous 3 years. For example, if a professional component of a
> previous procedure is billed in a 3 year time period, e.g., a lab
> interpretation is billed and no E/M service or other face-to-face
> service with the patient is performed, then this patient remains a new
> patient for the initial visit. An interpretation of a diagnostic test,
> reading an x-ray or EKG etc., in the absence of an E/M service or
> other face-to-face service with the patient does not affect the
> designation of a new patient.

### Office/Outpatient E/M Visits Provided on Same Day for Unrelated Problems

> As for all other E/M services except where specifically noted, the
> Medicare Administrative Contractors (MACs) may not pay two E/M office
> visits billed by a physician (or physician of the same specialty from
> the same group practice) for the same beneficiary on the same day
> unless the physician documents that the visits were for unrelated
> problems in the office, off campus-outpatient hospital, or on
> campus-outpatient hospital setting which could not be provided during
> the same encounter (e.g., office visit for blood pressure medication
> evaluation, followed five hours later by a visit for evaluation of leg
> pain following an accident).

### Office/Outpatient or Emergency Department E/M Visit on Day of Admission to Nursing Facility

> MACs may not pay a physician for an emergency department visit or an
> office visit **and** a comprehensive nursing facility assessment on
> the same day. Bundle E/M visits on the same date provided in sites
> other than the nursing facility into the initial nursing facility care
> code when performed on the same date as the nursing facility admission
> by the same physician *(see section on Nursing Facility Services
> below).*

### Drug Administration Services and E/M Visits Billed on Same Day of Service

> MACs must advise physicians that CPT code 99211 cannot be paid if it
> is billed with a drug administration service such as a chemotherapy or
> nonchemotherapy drug infusion code (effective January 1, 2004). This
> drug administration policy was expanded in the Physician Fee Schedule
> Final Rule, November 15, 2004, to also include a therapeutic or
> diagnostic injection code (effective January 1, 2005). Therefore, when
> a medically necessary, significant and separately identifiable E/M
> service (which meets a higher complexity level than CPT code 99211) is
> performed, in addition to one of these drug administration services,
> the appropriate E/M CPT code should be reported with modifier -25.
> Documentation should support the level of E/M service billed. For an
> E/M service provided on the same day, a different diagnosis is not
> required.

#### *Prolonged Office/Outpatient E/M Visits*

> *When the practitioner selects office/outpatient E/M visit level using
> time, the practitioner reports prolonged office/outpatient E/M visit
> time using HCPCS add-on code G2212 (Prolonged office/outpatient E/M
> services). See Prolonged Services section for additional information.*

#### *Add-On Code for Office/Outpatient E/M Visit Complexity*

> *Beginning January 1, 2021, Medicare established HCPCS add-on code
> G2211 describing visit complexity inherent to office/outpatient E/M
> visits associated with medical care services that serve as the
> continuing focal point for all needed health care services and/or with
> medical care services that are part of ongoing care related to a
> patient\'s single, serious condition, or a complex condition.*
>
> *HCPCS code G2211 (Visit complexity inherent to evaluation and
> management associated with medical care services that serve as the
> continuing focal point for all needed health care services and/or with
> medical care services that are part of ongoing care related to a
> patient's single, serious, or complex condition. (Add-on code, list
> separately in addition to office/outpatient evaluation and management
> visit, new or established)).*
>
> *The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021 delayed PFS payment for
> this code until January 1, CY 2024 or later. Practitioners may report
> this code for qualifying visits furnished on or after January 1, 2021,
> although we assigned a PFS payment status indicator of "B" (Bundled)
> until 2024.*

-   *HCPCS code G2211 includes services that enable practitioners to
    build longitudinal relationships with all patients (that is, not
    only those patients who have a chronic condition or single,
    high-risk disease) and to address the majority of patients' health
    care needs with consistency and continuity over longer periods of
    time. This includes furnishing services to patients on an ongoing
    basis that result in care that is personalized to the patient. The
    services result in a comprehensive, longitudinal, and continuous
    relationship with the patient and involve delivery of team-based
    care that is accessible, coordinated with other practitioners and
    providers, and integrated with the broader health care landscape.*

-   *Reporting is not restricted based on specialty, but certain
    specialties will likely furnish these types of visits more than
    other specialties. HCPCS code G2211 may be reported with any visit
    level.*

-   *Example 1: In the context of primary care, HCPCS code G2211 could
    recognize the resources inherent in holistic, patient-centered care
    that integrates the treatment of illness or injury, management of
    acute and chronic health conditions, and coordination of specialty
    care in a collaborative relationship with the clinical care team.*

-   *Example 2: In the context of specialty care, HCPCS code G2211 could
    recognize the resources inherent in engaging the patient in a
    continuous and active collaborative plan of care related to an
    identified health condition the management of which requires the
    direction of a clinician with specialized clinical knowledge, skill,
    and experience. Such collaborative care includes patient education,
    expectations and responsibilities, shared decision-making around
    therapeutic goals, and shared commitments to achieve those goals.*

-   *Example 3: We do not expect reporting of HCPCS code G2211 when the
    office/outpatient E/M visit is reported with payment modifiers such
    as a modifier -24, -25, or -53.*

#### *Medical Review When Practitioners Use Time to Select Visit Level*

> *Our reviewers will use the medical record documentation to
> objectively determine the medical necessity of the visit and accuracy
> of the documentation of the time spent (whether documented via a
> start/stop time or documentation of total time) if time is relied upon
> to support the E/M visit.*

1.  []{#_bookmark31 .anchor}**- Payment for Hospital Observation
    Services and Observation or Inpatient Care Services (Including
    Admission and Discharge Services) *(Rev. 11842; Issued; 02-09-23
    Effective:01-01-23; Implementation: 05-09-23)***

### Who May Bill Observation Care Codes

> Observation care is a well-defined set of specific, clinically
> appropriate services, which include ongoing short-term treatment,
> assessment, and reassessment, that are furnished while a decision is
> being made regarding whether patients will require further treatment
> as hospital inpatients or if they are able to be discharged from the
> hospital. Observation services are commonly ordered for patients who
> present to the emergency department and who then require a significant
> period of treatment or monitoring in order to make a decision
> concerning their admission or discharge.
>
> In only rare and exceptional cases do reasonable and necessary
> outpatient observation services span more than 48 hours. In the
> majority of cases, the decision whether to discharge a patient from
> the hospital following resolution of the reason for the observation
> care or to admit the patient as an inpatient can be made in less than
> 48 hours, usually in less than 24 hours.
>
> A/B MACs (B) pay for initial observation care billed by only the
> physician who ordered hospital outpatient observation services and was
> responsible for the patient during his/her observation care. A
> physician who does not have inpatient admitting privileges but who is
> authorized to furnish hospital outpatient observation services may
> bill these codes.
>
> For a physician to bill observation care codes, there must be a
> medical observation record for the patient which contains dated and
> timed physician's orders regarding the observation services the
> patient is to receive, nursing notes, and progress notes prepared by
> the physician while the patient received observation services. This
> record must be in addition to any record prepared as a result of an
> emergency department or outpatient clinic encounter.
>
> Payment for an initial observation care code is for all the care
> rendered by the ordering physician on the date the patient's
> observation services began. All other physicians who furnish
> consultations or additional evaluations or services while the patient
> is receiving hospital outpatient observation services must bill the
> appropriate outpatient service codes.
>
> For example, if an internist orders observation services and asks
> another physician to additionally evaluate the patient, only the
> internist may bill the initial and subsequent observation care codes.
> The other physician who evaluates the patient must bill the new or
> established office or other outpatient visit codes as appropriate.
>
> For information regarding hospital billing of observation services,
> see Chapter 4, §290.

### Physician Billing for Observation Care Following Initiation of Observation Services

> *Starting in CY 2023, hospital inpatient and observation care by
> practitioners will be billed using the same CPT codes, CPT codes 99221
> through 99223, 99231 through 99233, and 99238 and 99239. (CPT 99234
> through 99236 are already used for billing hospital inpatient or
> observation care (including admission or discharge.) Although
> observation care codes (CPT codes 99218 through 99220 and 99224
> through 99226) are being deleted, practitioners will still be able to
> furnish and bill for observation services using the revised Hospital
> Inpatient or Observation Care Services code set. Where noted, the term
> "observation care code" applies to Hospital Inpatient or Observation
> Care Services codes (CPT codes 99221-99223, 99231- 99239.)*
>
> *The time counted toward the Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care
> codes is "per day." "Per day," also referred to as "date of
> encounter," means the "calendar date." When using MDM or time for code
> selection, a continuous service that spans the transition of 2
> calendar dates is a single service and is reported on one date, which
> is the date the encounter begins. If the service is continuous, before
> and through midnight, all the time may be applied to the reported date
> of the service (that is, the calendar date the encounter began).*
>
> *A billing practitioner shall bill only one of the hospital inpatient
> or observation care codes for an initial visit, a subsequent visit, or
> inpatient or observation care (including admission and discharge), as
> appropriate, once per calendar date. The practitioner selects a code

C.  **Documentation Requirements for Billing *Hospital Inpatient or
    Observation* Care Services (Including Admission and Discharge
    Services)**

> The physician shall satisfy the E/M documentation guidelines for
> furnishing observation care or inpatient hospital care. In addition to
> meeting the documentation requirements for *medically appropriate
> history and/or examination,* and medical decision making,
> documentation in the medical record shall include:

-   Documentation stating the stay for observation care or inpatient
    hospital care involves 8 hours, but less than 24 hours;

-   Documentation identifying the billing physician was present and
    personally performed the services; and

-   Documentation identifying the order for observation services,
    progress notes, and discharge notes were written by the billing
    physician.

> In the rare circumstance when a patient receives observation services
> for more than 2 calendar dates, the physician shall bill observation
> services furnished on day(s) other than the initial or discharge date
> using subsequent observation care codes.

### Admission to Inpatient Status Following Observation Care

> *For the purposes of reporting an initial hospital inpatient or
> observation care service, a transition from observation status to
> inpatient status does not constitute a new stay.*
>
> If the same physician who ordered hospital outpatient observation
> services also admits the patient to inpatient status before the end of
> the date on which the patient began receiving hospital outpatient
> observation services, pay only an initial hospital visit for the
> evaluation and management services provided on that date. Medicare
> payment for the initial hospital visit includes all services provided
> to the patient on the date of admission by that physician, regardless
> of the site of service. The physician may not bill an initial or
> subsequent observation care code for services on the date that he or
> she admits the patient to inpatient status. If the patient is admitted
> to inpatient status from hospital outpatient observation care
> subsequent to the date of initiation of observation services, the
> physician must bill a *subsequent hospital inpatient or observation
> care code* for the services provided on that date. The
>
> physician may not bill the hospital *inpatient or* observation
> discharge management code (*CPT codes 99238-99239*) or an
> outpatient/office visit for the care provided while the patient
> received hospital outpatient observation services on the date of
> admission to inpatient status. *Note that in some cases, practitioners
> may bill a prolonged code in addition to the Hospital Inpatient or
> Observation Care Services base code; time spent by the same
> practitioner on the same day for the same patient in multiple settings
> (or for a patient who transitions between outpatient and inpatient
> status) may be counted toward the Hospital Inpatient or Observation
> Care Services base code and, if applicable, a prolonged code. Refer to
> section 30.6.9.F.)*

### Hospital Observation Services During Global Surgical Period

> The global surgical fee includes payment for hospital observation
> *care* services unless the criteria for use of CPT modifiers "-24,"
> "-25," or "-57" are met. A/B MACs (B) must pay for these services in
> addition to the global surgical fee only if both of the following
> requirements are met:

-   The hospital observation service meets the criteria needed to
    justify billing it with CPT modifiers "-24," "-25," or "-57"
    (decision for major surgery); and

-   The hospital observation service furnished by the surgeon meets all
    of the criteria for the hospital observation code billed.

> Examples of the decision for surgery during a hospital observation
> period are:

-   An emergency department physician orders hospital outpatient
    observation services for a patient with a head injury. A
    neurosurgeon is called in to evaluate the need for surgery while the
    patient is receiving observation services and decides that the
    patient requires surgery. The surgeon would bill a new or
    established office or other outpatient visit code as appropriate
    with the "-57" modifier to indicate that the decision for surgery
    was made during the evaluation. The surgeon must bill the office or
    other outpatient visit code because the patient receiving hospital
    outpatient observation services is not an inpatient of the hospital.
    Only the physician who ordered hospital outpatient observation
    services may bill for observation care.

-   A neurosurgeon orders hospital outpatient observation services for a
    patient with a head injury. During the observation period, the
    surgeon makes the decision for surgery. The surgeon would bill the
    appropriate level of hospital observation code with the "-57"
    modifier to indicate that the decision for surgery was made while
    the surgeon was providing hospital observation care.

> Examples of hospital observation services during the postoperative
> period of a surgery are:

-   A surgeon orders hospital outpatient observation services for a
    patient with abdominal pain from a kidney stone on the 80th day
    following a TURP (performed by that surgeon). The surgeon decides
    that the patient does not require surgery. The surgeon would bill
    the observation code with CPT modifier "-24" and documentation to
    support that the observation services are unrelated to the surgery.

-   A surgeon orders hospital outpatient observation services for a
    patient with abdominal pain on the 80th day following a TURP
    (performed by that surgeon). While the patient is receiving hospital
    outpatient observation services, the surgeon decides that the
    patient requires kidney surgery. The surgeon would bill the
    observation code with HCPCS modifier "-57" to indicate that the
    decision for surgery was made while the patient was receiving
    hospital outpatient observation services. The subsequent surgical
    procedure would be reported with modifier "-79."

-   A surgeon orders hospital outpatient observation services for a
    patient with abdominal pain on the 20th day following a resection of
    the colon (performed by that surgeon). The surgeon determines that
    the patient requires no further colon surgery and discharges the
    patient. The surgeon may not bill for the observation services
    furnished during the global period because they were related to the
    previous surgery.

> An example of a billable hospital observation service on the same day
> as a procedure is when a physician repairs a laceration of the scalp
> in the emergency department for a patient with a head injury and then
> subsequently orders hospital outpatient observation services for that
> patient. The physician would bill the observation code with a CPT
> modifier 25 and the procedure code.

# - Payment for Inpatient Hospital Visits - General

#### *(Rev. 11842; Issued; 02-09-23 Effective:01-01-23; Implementation: 05-09-23)*

> *Starting in CY 2023, hospital inpatient and observation care by
> practitioners will be billed using the same CPT codes, CPT codes 99221
> through 99223, 99231 through 99233, and 99238 and 99239. (CPT 99234
> through 99236 are already used for billing hospital inpatient or
> observation care (including admission or discharge.) Where they
> appear, references such as "hospital care," "hospital E/M" or
> "hospital inpatient care services" in this section apply to Hospital
> Inpatient or Observation Care Services codes (CPT codes 99221-99223,
> 99231- 99239.)*

### Hospital Visit and Critical Care on Same Day

> Hospital evaluation and management (E/M) visits may be billed the same
> day as critical care services in certain circumstances discussed in
> section 30.6.12. Documentation must support the claims as indicated in
> that section.
>
> During critical care management of a patient those services that do
> not meet the level of critical care shall be reported using an
> inpatient hospital care service with CPT Subsequent Hospital Care
> using a code from CPT code range 99231 - 99233.
>
> Both Initial Hospital Care (CPT codes 99221 - 99223) and Subsequent
> Hospital Care codes are "per diem" services and may be reported only
> once per day by the same physician or physicians of the same specialty
> from the same group practice.

### Two Hospital Visits Same Day

> *The time counted toward the Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care
> codes is "per day." "Per day," also referred to as "date of
> encounter," means the "calendar date." When using MDM or time for code
> selection, a continuous service that spans the transition of 2
> calendar dates is a single service and is reported on one date, which
> is the date the encounter begins. If the service is continuous, before
> and through midnight, all the time may be applied to the reported date
> of the service (that is, the calendar date the encounter began).*
>
> *A billing practitioner shall bill only one of the hospital inpatient
> or observation care codes for an initial visit, a subsequent visit, or
> inpatient or observation care (including admission and discharge), as
> appropriate, once per calendar date. The practitioner selects a code
> that reflects all of the practitioner's services provided during the
> date of the service. The definitions of "initial visit" and
> "subsequent visit" for the purposes of billing observation care using
> the Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care Services codes can be found
> in section 30.6.9.E.*
>
> A/B MACs (B) pay a physician for only one hospital visit per day for
> the same patient, whether the problems seen during the encounters are
> related or not.
>
> *Note that in some cases, practitioners may bill a prolonged code in
> addition to the Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care Services base
> code; time spent by the same practitioner on the same day for the same
> patient in multiple settings (or for a patient who transitions between
> outpatient and inpatient status) may be counted toward the Hospital
> Inpatient or Observation Care Services base code and, if applicable, a
> prolonged code. Refer to section 30.6.9.F.)*

### Hospital Visits Same Day But by Different Physicians

> In a hospital inpatient situation involving one physician covering for
> another, if physician A sees the patient in the morning and physician
> B, who is covering for A, sees the same patient in the evening, A/B
> MACs (B) do not pay physician B for the second visit. The hospital
> visit descriptors include the phrase "per day" meaning care for the
> day.
>
> If the physicians are each responsible for a different aspect of the
> patient's care, pay both visits if the physicians are in different
> specialties and the visits are billed with different diagnoses.
>
> There are circumstances where concurrent care may be billed by
> physicians of the same specialty.

### Visits to Patients in Swing Beds

> If the inpatient care is being billed by the hospital as inpatient
> hospital care, the hospital care codes apply. If the inpatient care is
> being billed by the hospital as nursing facility care, then the
> nursing facility codes apply.

#### *Definition of Initial and Subsequent Visit*

> *An initial service is one that occurs when the patient has not
> received any professional services from the physician or NPP or
> another physician or NPP of the same specialty who belongs to the same
> group practice during the stay.*
>
> *A subsequent service is one that occurs when the patient has received
> any professional services from the physician or NPP or another
> physician or NPP of the same specialty who belongs to the same group
> practice during the stay*.

#### *Prolonged Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care Services*

> *Beginning January 1, 2023, prolonged services are reported for
> certain hospital inpatient or observation care visits using G0316.
> Prolonged services can be reported when time is used to select visit
> level, and the total practitioner time for the highest-level visit is
> exceeded by 15 or more minutes for services that are medically

### Documentation Requirements for Billing *Hospital Inpatient or* Observation Care Services (Including Admission and Discharge Services)

> The physician shall satisfy the E/M documentation guidelines for
> admission to and discharge from inpatient observation or hospital
> care. In addition to meeting the documentation requirements for
> *medically appropriate history and/or examination,* and medical
> decision making documentation in the medical record shall include:

-   Documentation stating the stay for hospital treatment or observation
    > care status involves 8 hours but less than 24 hours;

-   Documentation identifying the billing physician was present and
    > personally performed the services; and

-   Documentation identifying the admission and discharge notes were
    > written by the billing physician.

### Physician Services Involving Transfer From One Hospital to Another; Transfer Within Facility to Prospective Payment System (PPS) Exempt Unit of Hospital; Transfer From One Facility to Another Separate Entity Under Same Ownership and/or Part of Same Complex; or Transfer From One Department to Another Within Single Facility

> Physicians may bill both the hospital discharge management code and an
> initial hospital care code when the discharge and admission do not
> occur on the same day if the transfer is between:

-   Different hospitals;

-   Different facilities under common ownership which do not have merged
    > records; or

-   Between the acute care hospital and a PPS exempt unit within the
    > same hospital when there are no merged records.

> In all other transfer circumstances, the physician should bill only
> the appropriate level of subsequent hospital care for the date of
> transfer.

F.  **Initial Hospital Care Service *Requirements***

> *Per the CPT code descriptors for Initial Hospital Inpatient or
> Observation Care Services, a medically appropriate history and/or
> examination will be required, but will no longer be used to select
> visit level. Practitioners working in hospitals should continue to be
> aware of the documentation needed to meet requirements for other
> payment systems or Conditions of Participation, in addition to the
> documentation required to bill Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care
> codes under the PFS.*
>
> Physicians who provide an initial visit to a patient during inpatient
> hospital care that meets the *code descriptor* requirements shall
> report an initial hospital care code (99221-99223). The principal
> physician of record shall append modifier "-AI" (Principal Physician
> of Record) to the claim for the initial hospital care code. This
> modifier will identify the physician who oversees the patient's care
> from all other physicians who may be furnishing specialty care.
>
> Physicians may bill initial hospital care service codes (99221-99223),
> for services that were reported with CPT consultation codes (99241 -
> 99255) prior to January 1, 2010, when the furnished service and
> documentation meet the *Initial Hospital Inpatient or Observation Care
> code descriptor* requirements. Physicians must meet all the
> requirements of the initial hospital care codes, to report CPT code
> 99221, which are greater than the requirements for consultation codes
> 99251 and 99252.
>
> Reporting CPT code 99499 (Unlisted evaluation and management service)
> should be limited to cases where there is no other specific E/M code
> payable by Medicare that describes that service. Reporting CPT code
> 99499 requires submission of medical records and A/B MAC (B) manual
> medical review of the service prior to payment. A/B MACs (B) shall
> expect reporting under these circumstances to be unusual.

### Initial Hospital Care Visits by Two Different M.D.s or D.O.s When They Are Involved in Same Admission

> In the inpatient hospital setting all physicians (and qualified
> nonphysician practitioners where permitted) who perform an initial
> evaluation may bill the initial hospital care codes (99221 - 99223) or
> nursing facility care codes (99304 - 99306). A/B MACs (B) consider
> only one M.D. or D.O. to be the principal physician of record
> (sometimes referred to as the admitting physician.) The principal
> physician of record is identified in Medicare as the physician who
> oversees the patient's care from other physicians who may be
> furnishing specialty care. Only the principal physician of record
> shall append modifier "-AI" (Principal Physician of Record) in
> addition to the E/M code. Follow-up visits in the facility setting
> shall be billed as subsequent hospital care visits and subsequent
> nursing facility care visits.

> even if the patient is discharged from the facility on a different
> calendar date. Only one hospital *inpatient or observation* discharge
> day management service is payable per patient per hospital stay.
>
> Only the attending physician of record reports the discharge day
> management service. Physicians or qualified nonphysician
> practitioners, other than the attending physician, who have been

> furnishing additional observation care services bill the appropriate
> office/outpatient code, per section 30.6.8.B.*

C.  **Subsequent Hospital *Inpatient or Observation* Visit and Discharge
    Management on Same Day**

> Pay only the hospital *inpatient or observation* discharge management
> code on the day of discharge (unless it is also the day of admission,
> in which case, refer to §30.6.9.1 C for the policy on *Hospital
> Inpatient or* Observation Care Services (Including Admission and

### Hospital *Inpatient or Observation* Discharge Management (CPT Codes 99238 and 99239) and Nursing Facility Admission Code When Patient Is Discharged From Hospital and Admitted to Nursing Facility on Same Day

> A/B MACs (B) pay the hospital *inpatient or observation* discharge
> code (codes 99238 or 99239) in addition to a nursing facility
> admission code when they are billed by the same physician with the
> same date of service.
>
> If a surgeon is admitting the patient to the nursing facility due to a
> condition that is not as a result of the surgery during the
> postoperative period of a service with the global surgical period,
> he/she bills for the nursing facility admission and care with a
> modifier "-24" and provides documentation that the service is
> unrelated to the surgery (e.g., return of an elderly patient to the
> nursing facility in which he/she has resided for five years following
> discharge from the hospital for cholecystectomy).
>
> A/B MACs (B) do not pay for a nursing facility admission by a surgeon
> in the postoperative period of a procedure with a global surgical
> period if the patient's admission to the nursing facility is to
> receive post operative care related to the surgery (e.g., admission to
> a nursing facility to receive physical therapy following a hip
> replacement). Payment for the nursing facility admission and
> subsequent nursing facility services are included in the global fee
> and cannot be paid separately.

E.  **Hospital *Inpatient or Observation* Discharge Management and Death
    Pronouncement**

> Only the physician who personally performs the pronouncement of death
> shall bill for the face- to-face Hospital *Inpatient or Observation*
> Discharge Day Management Service, CPT code 99238 or 99239. The date of
> the pronouncement shall reflect the calendar date of service on the

# - Emergency Department Visits (Codes 99281 - 99288)

### (Rev. 1875, Issued: 12-14-09, Effective: 01-01-10, Implementation: 01-04-10)

A.  **Use of Emergency Department Codes by Physicians Not Assigned to
    Emergency Department**

> Any physician seeing a patient registered in the emergency department
> may use emergency department visit codes (for services matching the
> code description). It is not required that the physician be assigned
> to the emergency department.

### Use of Emergency Department Codes In Office

> Emergency department coding is not appropriate if the site of service
> is an office or outpatient setting or any sight of service other than
> an emergency department. The emergency department codes should only be
> used if the patient is seen in the emergency department and the
> services described by the HCPCS code definition are provided. The
> emergency department is defined as an organized hospital-based
> facility for the provision of unscheduled or episodic services to
> patients who present for immediate medical attention.

### Use of Emergency Department Codes to Bill Nonemergency Services

> Services in the emergency department may not be emergencies. However
> the codes (99281 - 99288) are payable if the described services are
> provided.
>
> However, if the physician asks the patient to meet him or her in the
> emergency department as an alternative to the physician's office and
> the patient is not registered as a patient in the emergency
> department, the physician should bill the appropriate
> office/outpatient visit codes. Normally a lower level emergency
> department code would be reported for a nonemergency condition.

### Emergency Department or Office/Outpatient Visits on Same Day As Nursing Facility Admission

> Emergency department visit provided on the same day as a comprehensive
> nursing facility assessment are not paid. Payment for evaluation and
> management services on the same date provided in sites other than the
> nursing facility are included in the payment for initial nursing
> facility care when performed on the same date as the nursing facility
> admission.

### Physician Billing for Emergency Department Services Provided to Patient by Both Patient's Personal Physician and Emergency Department Physician

> If a physician advises his/her own patient to go to an emergency
> department (ED) of a hospital for care and the physician subsequently
> is asked by the ED physician to come to the hospital to evaluate the
> patient and to advise the ED physician as to whether the patient
> should be admitted to the hospital or be sent home, the physicians
> should bill as follows:

-   If the patient is admitted to the hospital by the patient's personal
    physician, then the patient's regular physician should bill only the
    appropriate level of the initial hospital care (codes 99221 - 99223)
    because all evaluation and management services provided by that
    physician in conjunction with that admission are considered part of
    the initial hospital care when performed on the same date as the
    admission. The ED physician who saw the patient in the emergency
    department should bill the appropriate level of the ED codes.

-   If the ED physician, based on the advice of the patient's personal
    physician who came to the emergency department to see the patient,
    sends the patient home, then the ED physician should bill the
    appropriate level of emergency department service. The patient's
    personal physician should also bill the level of emergency
    department code that describes the service he or she provided in the
    emergency department. If the patient's personal physician does not
    come to the hospital to see the patient, but only advises the
    emergency department physician by telephone, then the patient's
    personal physician may not bill.

### Emergency Department Physician Requests Another Physician to See the Patient in Emergency Department or Office/Outpatient Setting

> If the emergency department physician requests that another physician
> evaluate a given patient, the other physician should bill an emergency
> department visit code. If the patient is admitted to the hospital by
> the second physician performing the evaluation, he or she should bill
> an initial hospital care code and not an emergency department visit
> code.

# - Critical Care Visits and Neonatal Intensive Care (Codes 99291 - 99292)

> **(Rev. 11288; Issued:0 3-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation:
> 02-15-22)**

# -- Definition

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> For payment under the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS), Medicare
> adopts the definition of critical care services in the CPT Codebook,
> and the CPT listing of bundled services, unless otherwise specified.
> This includes the CPT prefatory language stating that critical care is
> the direct delivery by a physician(s) or other qualified healthcare
> professional (QHP) of medical care for a critically ill/injured
> patient in which there is acute impairment of one or more vital organ
> systems, such that there is a probability of imminent or
> life-threatening deterioration of the patient's condition. It involves
> high complexity decision-making to treat single or multiple vital
> organ system failure and/or to prevent further life-threatening
> deterioration of the patient's condition.
>
> Bundled services that are included by CPT in critical care services
> and therefore not separately payable include interpretation of cardiac
> output measurements, chest X rays, pulse oximetry, blood gases and
> collection and interpretation of physiologic data (for example, ECGs,
> blood pressures, hematologic data), gastric intubation, temporary
> transcutaneous pacing, ventilator management, and vascular access
> procedures. As a result, these codes are not separately billable by a
> practitioner during the time-period when the practitioner is providing
> critical care for a given patient. Time spent performing separately
> reportable procedures or services should be reported separately and
> should not be included in the time reported as critical care time.
>
> Because critical care services are delivered by a physician(s) or
> QHP(s), critical care may be reported by physicians and other
> practitioners who are qualified by education, training,
> licensure/regulation (when applicable), facility privileging (when
> applicable), and the applicable Medicare benefit category to perform
> critical care services and independently report them, referred to in
> this manual section as physicians and non-physician practitioners
> (NPPs).
>
> As specified in CPT prefatory language, critical care may be furnished
> on multiple days, and is typically furnished in a critical care area,
> which can include an intensive care unit or emergency care facility.
> Critical care requires the full attention of the physician or NPP and
> therefore, for any given time period spent providing critical care
> services, the practitioner cannot provide services to any other
> patient during the same period of time.

# - Critical Care by a Single Physician or NPP

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> For payment of critical care by a single physician or NPP, we are
> adopting CPT's reporting rules. When a single physician or NPP
> furnishes 30 -74 minutes of critical care services to a patient on a
> given date, the physician or NPP will report CPT code 99291. CPT code
> 99291 will be used only once per date even if the time spent by the
> practitioner is not continuous on that date. Thereafter, the physician
> or NPP will report CPT code 99292 for additional 30- minute time
> increments provided to the same patient.
>
> CPT codes 99291 and 99292 will be used to report the total duration of
> time spent by the physician or NPP providing critical care services to
> a critically ill or critically injured patient, even if the time spent
> by the practitioner on that date is not continuous. Non-continuous
> time for medically necessary critical care services may be aggregated.
>
> Regarding critical care services crossing midnight, CPT guidance
> defines how a service is to be billed when the service extends across
> calendar dates. For continuous services that extend beyond midnight,
> the physician or NPP will report the total units of time provided
> continuously. Any disruption in the service, however, creates a new
> initial service. We are adopting this rule for critical care being
> furnished by a single physician or NPP when the critical care crosses
> midnight.

# - Critical Care Visits Furnished Concurrently by Different Specialties

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> Concurrent care is when more than one physician renders services that
> are more extensive than consultative services during a period of time.
> The reasonable and necessary services of each physician furnishing
> concurrent care is covered when each plays an active role in the
> patient's treatment. In the context of critical care services, a
> critically ill patient may have more than one medical condition
> requiring diverse, specialized medical services and requiring more
> than one practitioner, each having a different specialty, playing an
> active role in the patient's treatment.
>
> Medicare policy allows critical care visits furnished as concurrent
> care (or concurrently) to the same patient on the same date by more
> than one practitioner in more than one specialty (for example, an
> internist and a surgeon, allergist and a cardiologist, neurosurgeon
> and NPP), regardless of group affiliation, if the service meets the
> definition of critical care and is not duplicative of other services.
> Additionally, these critical care visits need to be medically
> reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or
> injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member.

# - Critical Care Furnished Concurrently by Practitioners in the Same Specialty and Same Group (Follow-Up Care)

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> Physician(s) or NPP(s) in the same specialty and in the same group may
> provide concurrent follow-up care, such as a critical care visit
> subsequent to another practitioner's critical care visit. This may be
> as part of continuous staff coverage or follow-up care to critical
> care services furnished earlier in the day on the same calendar date.
>
> In the situation where a practitioner furnishes the initial critical
> care service in its entirety and reports CPT code 99291, any
> additional practitioner(s) in the same specialty and the same group
> furnishing care concurrently to the same patient on the same date
> report their time using the code for subsequent time intervals (CPT
> code 99292). CPT code 99291 will not be reported more than once for
> the same patient on the same date by these practitioners. This policy
> recognizes that multiple practitioners in the same specialty and the
> same group can maintain continuity of care by providing follow-up care
> for the same patient on a single date.
>
> When one practitioner begins furnishing the initial critical care
> service, but does not meet the time required to report CPT code 99291,
> another practitioner in the same specialty and group can continue to
> deliver critical care to the same patient on the same date. The total
> time spent by the practitioners is aggregated to meet the time
> requirement to bill CPT code 99291. Once the cumulative required
> critical care service time is met to report CPT code 99291, CPT code
> 99292 can only be reported by a practitioner in the same specialty and
> group when an additional 30 minutes of critical care services have
> been furnished to the same patient on the same date (74 minutes + 30
> minutes = 104 total minutes).
>
> The aggregated time spent on critical care visits must be medically
> necessary and each visit must meet the definition of critical care in
> order to add the times for purposes of meeting the time requirement to
> bill CPT code 99291.
>
> For purposes of payment under the Physician Fee Schedule, Medicare
> classifies NPPs in a specialty that is not the same as a physician
> with whom the NPP is working, so the policies above would not apply to
> the situation where an NPP provides the follow-up care to a physician,
> or vice versa. Instead, see the section below regarding split (or
> shared) critical care []{#_bookmark37 .anchor}services.

# - Split (or Shared) Critical Care Visits

### (Rev. 11828; Issued: 02-02-23; Effective: 01-01-23; Implementation: 03-03-23)

> Critical care visits may be furnished as split (or shared) visits,
> defined in section 30.6.18. The rules described in section 30.6.18 for
> other types of split (or shared) visits apply (except for the listing
> of qualifying activities for determining the substantive portion,
> discussed below), and service time is counted for CPT code 99292 in
> the same way as for prolonged E/M services.
>
> Specifically, the billing practitioner bills the initial service (CPT
> 99291) and any add-on codes(s) for additional time (CPT 99292). Also,
> the substantive portion for critical care services is defined as more
> than half of the total time spent by the physician and NPP beginning
> January 1, 2022. In the context of critical care, split (or shared)
> visits occur when the total critical care service time furnished by a
> physician and NPP in the same group on a given calendar date to a
> patient is summed, and the practitioner who furnishes the substantive
> portion of the cumulative critical care time reports the critical care
> service(s).
>
> As stated earlier, when critical care services are furnished as a
> split (or shared) visit, the substantive portion is defined as more
> than half the cumulative total time in qualifying activities that are
> included in CPT codes 99291 and 99292. Since, unlike other types of
> E/M visits, critical care services can include additional activities
> that are bundled into the critical care visits code(s), there is a
> unique listing of qualifying activities for split (or shared) critical
> care. These qualifying activities are described in the prefatory
> language for critical care services in the CPT Codebook.
>
> To bill split (or shared) critical care services, the billing
> practitioner first reports CPT code 99291 and, if 104 or more
> cumulative total minutes are spent providing critical care, the
> billing practitioner reports one or more units of CPT code 99292.
> Modifier -FS (split or shared E/M visit) must be appended to the
> critical care CPT code(s) on the claim.
>
> The same documentation rules apply for split (or shared) critical care
> visits as for other types of split (or shared) E/M visits. Consistent
> with all split (or shared) visits, when two or more practitioners
> spend time jointly meeting with or discussing the patient as part of a
> critical care service, the time can be counted only once for purposes
> of reporting the split (or shared) critical care visit.

# - Critical Care and Other Same-Day Evaluation and Management (E/M) Visits

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> Our general policy, as described in section 30.6.5, states that
> physicians in the same group who are in the same specialty must bill
> and be paid for services under the PFS as though they were a single
> physician. If more than one E/M visit is provided on the same date to
> the same patient by the same physician, or by more than one physician
> in the same specialty in the same group, only one E/M service may be
> reported, unless the E/M services are for unrelated problems.
>
> Instead of billing separately, the physicians should select a level of
> service representative of the combined visits and submit the
> appropriate code for that level. This general policy is intended to
> ensure that multiple E/M visits for a patient on a single day are
> medically necessary and not duplicative.
>
> However, in situations where a patient receives another E/M visit on
> the same calendar date as critical care services, both may be billed
> (regardless of practitioner specialty or group affiliation) as long as
> the medical record documentation supports: 1) that the other E/M visit
> was provided prior to the critical care services at a time when the
> patient did not require critical care, 2) that the services were
> medically necessary, and 3) that the services were separate and
> distinct, with no duplicative elements from the critical care services
> provided later in the day.
>
> Practitioners must use modifier -25 (same-day significant, separately
> identifiable evaluation and management service) on the claim when
> reporting these critical care services.

# - Critical Care Visits and Global Surgery

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> Critical care visits are sometimes needed during the global period of
> a procedure, whether pre- operatively, on the same day, or during the
> post-operative period. In some cases, preoperative and postoperative
> critical care visits are included in procedure codes that have a
> global surgical period.
>
> In those cases where a critical care visit is unrelated to the
> procedure with a global surgical period, critical care visits may be
> paid separately in addition to the procedure. Preoperative and/or
> postoperative critical care may be paid in addition to the procedure
> if the patient is critically ill (meets the definition of critical
> care) and requires the full attention of the physician, and the
> critical care is above and beyond and unrelated to the specific
> anatomic injury or general surgical procedure performed (for example,
> trauma, burn cases). When the critical care service is unrelated to
> the procedure, append the modifier -FT ((unrelated evaluation and
> management (E/M) visit on the same day as another E/M visit or during
> a global procedure (preoperative, postoperative period, or on the same
> day as the procedure, as applicable). (Report when an E/M visit is
> furnished within the global period but is unrelated, or when one or
> more additional E/M visits furnished on the same day are unrelated.))
> to the critical care CPT code(s).
>
> If care is fully transferred from the surgeon to an intensivist (and
> the critical care is unrelated), modifiers -54 (surgical care only)
> and -55 (postoperative management only) must also be reported to
> indicate the transfer of care. The surgeon will report modifier -54.
> The intensivist accepting the transfer of care will report both
> modifier -55 and modifier -FT. As usual, medical record documentation
> must support the claims.

# - Medical Record Documentation

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> Critical care is a time-based service, and therefore, practitioners
> must document in the medical record the total time (not necessarily
> start and stop times) that critical care services are furnished by
> each reporting practitioner. Documentation needs to indicate that the
> services furnished to the patient, including any concurrent care by
> the practitioners, are medically reasonable and necessary for the
> diagnosis and/or treatment of illness and/or injury or to improve the
> functioning of a malformed body member.
>
> To support coverage and payment determinations regarding concurrent
> care, services must be sufficiently documented to allow a medical
> reviewer to determine the role each practitioner played in the
> patient's care (that is, the condition or conditions for which the
> practitioner treated the patient).
>
> When critical care services are reported the same date as another E/M
> visit, the medical record documentation must support: 1) that the
> other E/M visit was provided prior to the critical care services at a
> time when the patient did not require critical care, 2) that the
> services were medically necessary, and 3) that the services were
> separate and distinct, with no duplicative elements from the critical
> care services provided later on that date.
>
> When critical care services are furnished in conjunction with a global
> procedure, the medical record documentation must support that the
> critical care was unrelated to the procedure, as discussed above.
>
> To support coverage and payment determinations regarding split (or
> shared) critical care services, the documentation requirements for all
> split (or shared) E/M visits apply to critical care visits also (see
> section 30.6.18).

### Visits to Perform the Initial Comprehensive Assessment and Annual Assessments

> The distinction made between the delegation of physician visits and

### Medically Necessary Visits

> Qualified NPPs may perform medically necessary E/M visits prior to and
> after the physician's initial federally mandated visit in both the SNF
> and NF. Medically necessary E/M visits for the diagnosis or treatment
> of an illness or injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed

> facility care code (CPT codes 99307-99310), even if the E/M service is
> provided prior to the initial federally mandated visit.

### SNF Setting\--Place of Service Code 31

> Following the initial federally mandated visit by the physician, the
> physician may delegate alternate federally mandated physician visits
> to a qualified NPP who meets collaboration and physician supervision
> requirements and is licensed as such by the State and performing
> within the scope of practice in that State.

### NF Setting\--Place of Service Code 32

> Per the regulations at 42 CFR 483.40 (f), a qualified NPP, who meets
> the collaboration and physician supervision requirements, the State
> scope of practice and licensure requirements, and who is not employed
> by the NF, may at the option of the State, perform the initial

> Qualified NPPs in the NF setting, who are not employed by the NF and
> who are working in collaboration with a physician, may perform
> federally mandated physician visits, at the option of the State.
>
> Medicare Part B payment policy does not pay for additional E/M visits
> that may be required by State law for a facility admission or for
> other additional visits to satisfy facility or other administrative
> purposes. E/M visits, prior to and after the initial federally
> mandated physician visit, that are reasonable and medically necessary
> to meet the medical needs of the individual patient (unrelated to any
> State requirement or administrative purpose) are payable under
> Medicare Part B.

### Visits by Qualified Nonphysician Practitioners

> All E/M visits shall be within the State scope of practice and
> licensure requirements where the visit is performed and all the
> requirements for physician collaboration and physician supervision
> shall be met when performed and reported by qualified NPPs. General
> physician supervision and employer billing requirements shall be met
> for PA services in addition to the PA meeting the State scope of
> practice and licensure requirements where the E/M visit is performed.

### Medically Necessary Visits

> Qualified NPPs may perform medically necessary E/M visits prior to and
> after the physician's initial visit in both the SNF and NF. Medically
> necessary E/M visits for the diagnosis or treatment of an illness or
> injury or to improve the functioning of a malformed body member are
> payable under the physician fee schedule under Medicare Part B. A
> physician or NPP may
>
> bill the most appropriate initial nursing facility care code (CPT
> codes 99304-99306) or subsequent nursing facility care code (CPT codes
> 99307-99310), even if the E/M service is provided prior to the initial
> federally mandated visit.

### SNF Setting\--Place of Service Code 31

> Following the initial federally mandated visit by the physician, the
> physician may delegate alternate federally mandated physician visits
> to a qualified NPP who meets collaboration and physician supervision
> requirements and is licensed as such by the State and performing
> within the scope of practice in that State.

### NF Setting\--Place of Service Code 32

> Per the regulations at 42 CFR 483.40 (f), a qualified NPP, who meets
> the collaboration and physician supervision requirements, the State
> scope of practice and licensure requirements, and who is not employed
> by the NF, may at the option of the State, perform the initial
> federally mandated visit in a NF, and may perform any other federally
> mandated physician visit in a NF in addition to performing other
> medically necessary E/M visits.
>
> Questions pertaining to writing orders or certification and
> recertification issues in the SNF and NF settings shall be addressed
> to the appropriate State Survey and Certification Agency departments
> for clarification.

### Medically Complex Care

> Payment is made for E/M visits to patients in a SNF who are receiving
> services for medically complex care upon discharge from an acute care
> facility when the visits are reasonable and medically necessary and
> documented in the medical record. Physicians and qualified NPPs shall
> report initial nursing facility care codes for their first visit with
> the patient. The principal physician of record must append the
> modifier "-AI" (Principal Physician of Record), to the initial nursing
> facility care code when billed to identify the physician who oversees
> the patient's care from other physicians who may be furnishing
> specialty care. Follow-up visits shall be billed as subsequent nursing
> facility care visits.

### Incident to Services

> Where a physician establishes an office in a SNF/NF, the "incident to"
> services and requirements are confined to this discrete part of the
> facility designated as his/her office. "Incident to" E/M visits,
> provided in a facility setting, are not payable under the Physician
> Fee Schedule for Medicare Part B. Thus, visits performed outside the
> designated "office" area in the SNF/NF would be subject to the
> coverage and payment rules applicable to the SNF/NF setting and shall
> not be reported using the CPT codes for office or other outpatient
> visits or use place of service code 11.

### Prolonged *NF* Services

> Beginning January 1, 20*23*, *prolonged NF services are reported using
> Medicare-specific coding (HCPCS code G0317). Prolonged Services can be
> reported when time is used to select visit level, and the total time
> for the highest-level visit is exceeded by 15 or more minutes for
> services that are reasonable and medically necessary. See Prolonged
> Services section below for detailed reporting instructions on
> prolonged NF visits. Prolonged services are not reportable in
> conjunction with codes for NF discharge day management.*

### Multiple Visits

> The complexity level of an E/M visit and the CPT code billed must be a
> covered and medically necessary visit for each patient (refer to
> §§1862 (a)(1)(A) of the Act). Claims for an unreasonable number of
> daily E/M visits by the same physician to multiple patients at a
> facility within a 24-hour period may result in medical review to
> determine medical necessity for the visits. The E/M visit (Nursing
> Facility Services) represents a "per day" service per patient as
> defined by the CPT code. The medical record must be personally
> documented by the physician or qualified NPP who performed the E/M
> visit and the documentation shall support the specific level of E/M
> visit to each individual patient.

### Split (or Shared) SNF/NF E/M Visit

> SNF E/M visits may be billed as split (or shared) visits if they meet
> the rules for split (or shared) visit billing, discussed in our other
> manual sections, except for SNF E/M visits that are required to be
> performed in their entirety by a physician. NF visits do not meet the
> definition
>
> of split (or shared) services, and therefore, are not billable as
> such. See section 30.6.18 for additional information.

### SNF/NF Discharge Day Management Service

> Medicare Part B payment policy requires a face-to-face visit with the
> patient provided by the physician or the qualified NPP to meet the
> SNF/NF discharge day management service as defined by the CPT code.
> The E/M discharge day management visit shall be reported for the date
> of the actual visit by the physician or qualified NPP even if the
> patient is discharged from the facility on a different calendar date.
> The CPT codes 99315 - 99316 shall be reported for this visit. The
> Discharge Day Management Service may be reported using CPT code 99315
> or 99316, depending on the code requirement, for a patient who has
> expired, but only if the physician or qualified NPP personally
> performed the death pronouncement.

# - Home or Residence Services (Codes 99341- 99350)

> **Physician Visits to Patients Residing in Various Places of Service**
>
> Prior to January 1, 2023, the American Medical Association's [Current
> Procedural Terminology]{.underline} (CPT) used new patient codes
> 99324 - 99328 and established patient codes 99334 - 99337 for
> Domiciliary, Rest Home (e.g., Boarding Home), or Custodial Care
> Services, to report evaluation and management (E/M) services to
> residents residing in a facility which provides room, board, and other
> personal assistance services, generally on a long-term basis. These
> CPT codes were used to report E/M services in facilities assigned
> places of service (POS) codes 13 (Assisted Living Facility), 14 (Group
> Home), 33 (Custodial Care Facility) and 55 (Residential Substance
> Abuse Treatment Facility). Assisted living facilities may also be
> known as adult living facilities. The CPT codes 99324 - 99337 for
> Domiciliary, Rest Home (e.g., Boarding Home), or Custodial Care
> Services are deleted beginning January 1, 2023.
>
> Beginning January 1, 2023, the CPT is merging the two E/M visit
> families currently titled "Domiciliary, Rest Home (e.g., Boarding
> Home), or Custodial Care Services" and "Home Services." The new family
> will be titled "Home or Residence Services. The codes in this family
> (CPT codes 99341 -- 99350) will be used to report E/M services
> furnished to a patient residing in their home, in an assisted living
> facility, in a group home (that is not licensed as an intermediate
> care facility for individuals with intellectual disabilities), in a
> custodial care facility, or in a residential substance abuse treatment
> facility. There are no changes to the included care settings from each
> respective family, rather the current care settings for each of the
> current families are being included within the new, merged family. For
> services in an intermediate care facility for individuals with
> intellectual disabilities and services provided in a psychiatric
> residential treatment center, see Nursing Facility Services in Section
> 30.6.13.
>
> Physicians and qualified nonphysician practitioners (NPPs) furnishing
> E/M services to residents in a living arrangement described by one of
> the POS listed above must use the level of service code in the CPT
> code range 99341 - 99350 to report the service they provide.
>
> Beginning in 2006, reasonable and medically necessary prolonged
> services may be reported with the appropriate companion E/M codes when
> a physician or qualified NPP, provides a prolonged service that is
> beyond the usual E/M visit service for a Home or Residence Service.
> All the requirements for prolonged services at §30.6.15 must be met.
>
> Beginning in 2006, E/M services provided to patients residing in a
> Skilled Nursing Facility (SNF) or a Nursing Facility (NF) must be
> reported using the appropriate CPT level of service code within the
> range identified for Initial Nursing Facility Care (CPT codes 99304 -
> 99306) and Subsequent Nursing Facility Care (CPT codes 99307 - 99310).
> Use CPT codes 99315 -
>
> 99316 for SNF/NF discharge services. The Home or Residence Services
> codes should not be used for these places of service.
>
> The CPT SNF/NF code definition includes intermediate care facilities
> (ICFs) and long term care facilities (LTCFs). These codes are limited
> to the specific 2-digit POS 31 (SNF), 32 (Nursing Facility), 54
> (Intermediate Care Facility/Individuals with Intellectual
> Disabilities) and 56 (Psychiatric Residential Treatment Center).
>
> The CPT nursing facility codes should be used with POS 31 (SNF) if the
> patient is in a Part A SNF stay and POS 32 (nursing facility) if the
> patient does not have Part A SNF benefits. There is no longer a
> different payment amount for a Part A or Part B benefit period in
> these POS settings.

# - Home or Residence Services (Codes 99341 - 99350) When Performed in Place of Service 12 (Home)

### (Rev. 11732, Issued: 12-08-22, Effective: 01-01-23, Implementation: 01-03-23)

A.  **Requirement for Physician Presence in Place of Service 12 (Home)**

> A home visit using codes 99341-99350 with POS 12 cannot be billed by a
> physician unless the physician was actually present in the
> beneficiary's home. Section 10.1.1 in Chapter 1 of this manual
> provides additional information on billing with POS 12.

### Homebound Status

> Under the home health benefit the beneficiary must be confined to the
> home for services to be covered. For home services provided by a
> physician using 99341-99350 with POS 12, the beneficiary does not need
> to be confined to the home.

C.  **Fee Schedule Payment for Services to Homebound Patients under
    General Supervision** Payment may be made in some medically
    underserved areas where there is a lack of medical personnel and
    home health services for injections, EKGs, and venipunctures that
    are performed for homebound patients under general physician
    supervision by nurses and paramedical employees of physicians or
    physician-directed clinics. Section 60.4 in Chapter 15 of the
    Medicare Benefit Policy Manual (Pub. 100-02) provides additional
    information on the provision of services to homebound Medicare
    patients.

# - Power Mobility Devices (PMDs) (Code G0372)

### (Rev. 748, Issued: 11-04-05; Effective/Implementation Dates: 10-25-05)

> Section 302(a)(2)(E)(iv) of the Medicare Prescription Drug,
> Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 (MMA) sets forth revised
> conditions for Medicare payment of Power Mobility Devices (PMDs). This
> section of the MMA states that payment for motorized or power
> wheelchairs may not be made unless a physician (as defined in
> §1861(r)(1) of the Act), a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or
> a clinical nurse specialist (as those terms are defined in
> §1861(aa)(5)) has conducted a face-to-face examination of the
> beneficiary and written a prescription for the PMD.
>
> Payment for the history and physical examination will be made through

# - Split (or Shared) Visits

> ***(Rev. 11842; Issued; 02-09-23 Effective:01-01-23; Implementation:
> 05-09-23)***

### Definition of Split (or Shared) Visit

> A split (or shared) visit is an evaluation and management (E/M) visit
> in the facility setting that is performed in part by both a physician
> and a nonphysician practitioner (NPP) who are in the same group, in
> accordance with applicable law and regulations such that the service
> could be could be billed by either the physician or NPP if furnished
> independently by only one of them. Payment is made to the practitioner
> who performs the substantive portion of the visit.
>
> Facility setting means an institutional setting in which payment for
> services and supplies furnished incident to a physician or
> practitioner's professional services is prohibited under our
> regulations.

B.  ### Definition of Substantive Portion

    1.  **More Than Half of the Total Time**

> Beginning January 1, 202*4*, substantive portion means more than half
> of the total time spent by the physician and NPP performing the split
> (or shared) visit.
>
> During *the* transitional year from January 1, 202*3* through December
> 31, 202*3*, except for critical care visits, the substantive portion
> can be one of the three key E/M visit components (*a medically
> appropriate* history *or* exam, or medical decision-making (MDM)), or
> more than half of the total time spent by the physician and NPP
> performing the split (or shared) visit. In other words, for calendar
> year 202*3*, the practitioner who spends more than half of the total
> time, or performs the *medically appropriate* history *or* exam
> *described in the code descriptor*, or MDM can be considered to have
> performed the substantive portion and can bill for the split (or
> shared) E/M visit. When one of the three key components is used as the
> substantive portion in 202*3*, the practitioner who bills the visit
> must perform that component in its entirety in order to bill. For
> example, if history is used as the substantive portion, the billing
> practitioner must perform the history *as described in the code
> descriptor in order to bill*. If physical exam is used as the
> substantive portion, the billing practitioner must perform the exam
> *as described in the code descriptor in order to bill*. If MDM is used
> as the substantive portion, each practitioner could perform certain
> aspects of MDM, but the billing practitioner must perform all portions
> or aspects of MDM that are required to select the visit level billed.
>
> For critical care visits, starting for services furnished in CY 2022,
> the substantive portion will be more than half of the total time. A
> unique listing of qualifying activities for purposes of determining
> the substantive portion of critical care visits applies (see below).
>
> We summarize these policies in the following table.

### Distinct Time

> In accordance with the CPT E/M Guidelines, only distinct time can be
> counted. When the practitioners jointly meet with or discuss the
> patient, only the time of one of the practitioners can be counted.
>
> Example: If the NPP first spent 10 minutes with the patient and the
> physician then spent another 15 minutes, their individual time spent
> would be summed to equal a total of 25 minutes. The physician would
> bill for this visit, since they spent more than half of the total time
> (15 of 25 total minutes). If, in the same situation, the physician and
> NPP met together for five additional minutes (beyond the 25 minutes)
> to discuss the patient's treatment plan, that overlapping time could
> only be counted once for purposes of establishing total time and who
> provided the substantive portion of the visit. The total time would be
> 30 minutes, and the physician would bill for the visit, since they
> spent more than half of the total time (20 of 30 total minutes).

### Qualifying Time

> Drawing on the CPT E/M Guidelines, except for critical care visits,
> the following listing of activities can be counted toward total time
> for purposes of determining the substantive portion, when performed
> and whether or not the activities involve direct patient contact:

-   Preparing to see the patient (for example, review of tests).

-   Obtaining and/or reviewing separately obtained history.

-   Performing a medically appropriate examination and/or evaluation.

-   Counseling and educating the patient/family/caregiver.

-   Ordering medications, tests, or procedures.

-   Referring and communicating with other health care professionals
    (when not separately reported).

-   Documenting clinical information in the electronic or other health
    record.

-   Independently interpreting results (not separately reported) and
    communicating results to the patient/family/caregiver.

-   Care coordination (not separately reported).

> Practitioners cannot count time spent on the following:

-   The performance of other services that are reported separately.

-   Travel.

-   Teaching that is general and not limited to discussion that is
    required for the management of a specific patient.

> See section 30.6.12 for a listing of qualifying activities for
> purposes of determining the substantive portion of critical care
> services.
>
> For all split (or shared) visits, one of the practitioners must have
> face-to-face (in-person) contact with the patient, but it does not
> necessarily have to be the physician, nor the practitioner who
> performs the substantive portion and bills for the visit. The
> substantive portion can be entirely with or without direct patient
> contact, and is determined by the proportion of total time, not
> whether the time involves patient contact.

### Application to Prolonged Services

> *For 2022 and 2023 transitional years, the billing practitioner
> reports the codes for the primary service and the prolonged services,
> regardless of the amount of time the billing practitioner spent.*
>
> *Starting in 2024, since the substantive portion is more than half of
> the practitioners' total time, t*he physician or practitioner who
> spent more than half the total time (the substantive portion starting
> in 202*4*) will bill for the primary E/M visit and the prolonged
> service code(s) when the service is furnished as a split (or shared)
> visit, if all other requirements to bill for split (or shared)
> services are met. The physician and NPP will add their time together,
> and whomever furnished more than half of the total time, including
> prolonged time, (that is, the substantive portion) will report both
> the primary service code and the prolonged services add-on code(s),
> assuming the time threshold for reporting prolonged services is met
> *(see Prolonged Services section above)*.

-   During the transitional calendar year*s* 2022*-2023*, when
    practitioners use a key component as the substantive portion,
    Emergency department and critical care visits are not reported as
    prolonged services.

> We summarize these policies in the following table.

### New and Established Patients, and Initial and Subsequent Visits

> Split (or shared) visits may be billed for new and established
> patients, as well as for initial and subsequent visits, that otherwise
> meet the requirements for split (or shared) visit payment.

### Settings of Care

> Split (or shared) visits are furnished only in the facility setting,
> meaning institutional settings in which payment for services and
> supplies furnished incident to a physician or practitioner's
> professional services is prohibited under our regulations at 42 CFR §
> 410.26.
>
> Accordingly, split (or shared) visits are billable for E/M visits
> furnished in hospital and skilled nursing facility (SNF) settings.
> Visits in these settings that are required by our regulations to be
> performed in their entirety by a physician are not billable as split
> (or shared) services. For example, our Conditions of Participation
> require certain SNF visits to be performed directly and solely by a
> physician; accordingly, those SNF visits cannot be billed as a split
> (or shared) visit (see Section 30.6.13).

### Medical Record Documentation

> Documentation in the medical record must identify the physician and
> NPP who performed the visit. The individual who performed the
> substantive portion of the visit (and therefore bills for the visit)
> must sign and date the medical record.

### Claim Identification

> Modifier -FS (Split or Shared E/M Visit) must be reported on claims
> for split (or shared) visits, to identify that the service was a split
> (or shared) visit.
>
> The modifier identified by CPT for purposes of reporting partial
> services (modifier -52 (reduced services)) cannot be used to report
> partial E/M visits, including any partial services furnished as split
> (or shared) visits. Medicare does not pay for partial E/M visits.

# - Surgeons and Global Surgery

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-4820

> A national definition of a global surgical package has been
> established to ensure that payment is made consistently for the same
> services across all A/B MAC (B) jurisdictions, thus preventing
> Medicare payments for services that are more or less comprehensive
> than intended. The national global surgery policy became effective for
> surgeries performed on and after January 1, 1992.
>
> The instructions that follow describe the components of a global
> surgical package and payment rules for minor surgeries, endoscopies
> and global surgical packages that are split between two or more
> physicians. In addition, billing, mandatory edits, claims review,
> adjudication, and postpayment instructions are included.
>
> In addition to the global policy, uniform payment policies and claims
> processing requirements have been established for other surgical
> issues, including bilateral and multiple surgeries, co- surgeons, and
> team surgeries.

# - Definition of a Global Surgical Package

### (Rev. 11287; Issued:03-02-22; Effective:01-01-22; Implementation: 02-22-22) B3-4821, B3-15900.2

> Field 16 of the Medicare Fee Schedule Data Base (MFSDB) provides the
> postoperative periods that apply to each surgical procedure. The
> payment rules for surgical procedures apply to codes with entries of
> 000, 010, 090, and, sometimes, YYY.
>
> Codes with "090" in Field 16 are major surgeries. Codes with "000" or
> "010" are either minor surgical procedures or endoscopies.
>
> Codes with "YYY" are A/B MAC (B)-priced codes, for which A/B MACs (B)
> determine the global period (the global period for these codes will be
> 0, 10, or 90 days). Note that not all A/B MAC (B)-priced codes have a
> "YYY" global surgical indicator; sometimes the global period is
> specified.
>
> While codes with "ZZZ" are surgical codes, they are add-on codes that
> are always billed with another service. There is no postoperative work
> included in the fee schedule payment for the "ZZZ" codes. Payment is
> made for both the primary and the add-on codes, and the global period
> assigned is applied to the primary code.

### Components of a Global Surgical Package B3-15011, B3-4820-4831

> A/B MACs (B) apply the national definition of a global surgical
> package to all procedures with the appropriate entry in Field 16 of
> the MFSDB.
>
> The Medicare approved amount for these procedures includes payment for
> the following services related to the surgery when furnished by the
> physician who performs the surgery. The services included in the
> global surgical package may be furnished in any setting, e.g., in
> hospitals, ASCs, physicians' offices. Visits to a patient in an
> intensive care or critical care unit are also included if made by the
> surgeon. However, critical care services (CPT codes 99291 and 99292)
> are payable separately in some situations. (See section 30.6.12.7 of
> this chapter for further discussion of critical care visits unrelated
> to the procedure with a global surgical period.)

-   Preoperative Visits - Preoperative visits after the decision is made
    to operate beginning with the day before the day of surgery for
    major procedures and the day of surgery for minor procedures;

-   Intra-operative Services - Intra-operative services that are
    normally a usual and necessary part of a surgical procedure;

-   Complications Following Surgery - All additional medical or surgical
    services required of the surgeon during the postoperative period of
    the surgery because of complications which do not require additional
    trips to the operating room;

-   Postoperative Visits - Follow-up visits during the postoperative
    period of the surgery that are related to recovery from the surgery;

-   Postsurgical Pain Management - By the surgeon;

-   Supplies - Except for those identified as exclusions; and

-   Miscellaneous Services - Items such as dressing changes; local
    incisional care; removal of operative pack; removal of cutaneous
    sutures and staples, lines, wires, tubes, drains, casts, and
    splints; insertion, irrigation and removal of urinary catheters,
    routine peripheral intravenous lines, nasogastric and rectal tubes;
    and changes and removal of tracheostomy tubes.

### Services Not Included in the Global Surgical Package

> A/B MACs (B) do not include the services listed below in the payment
> amount for a procedure with the appropriate indicator in Field 16 of
> the MFSDB. These services may be paid for separately.

-   The initial consultation or evaluation of the problem by the surgeon
    to determine the need for surgery. Please note that this policy only
    applies to major surgical procedures. The initial evaluation is
    always included in the allowance for a minor surgical procedure;

-   Services of other physicians except where the surgeon and the other
    physician(s) agree on the transfer of care. This agreement may be in
    the form of a letter or an annotation in the discharge summary,
    hospital record, or ASC record;

-   Visits unrelated to the diagnosis for which the surgical procedure
    is performed, unless the visits occur due to complications of the
    surgery;

-   Treatment for the underlying condition or an added course of
    treatment which is not part of normal recovery from surgery;

-   Diagnostic tests and procedures, including diagnostic radiological
    procedures;

-   Clearly distinct surgical procedures during the postoperative period
    which are not re- operations or treatment for complications. (A new
    postoperative period begins with the subsequent procedure.) This
    includes procedures done in two or more parts for which the decision
    to stage the procedure is made prospectively or at the time of the
    first procedure. Examples of this are procedures to diagnose and
    treat epilepsy (codes 61533, 61534-61536, 61539, 61541, and 61543)
    which may be performed in succession within 90 days of each other;

-   Treatment for postoperative complications which requires a return
    trip to the operating room (OR). An OR for this purpose is defined
    as a place of service specifically equipped and staffed for the sole
    purpose of performing procedures. The term includes a cardiac
    catheterization suite, a laser suite, and an endoscopy suite. It
    does not include a patient's room, a minor treatment room, a
    recovery room, or an intensive care unit (unless the patient's
    condition was so critical there would be insufficient time for
    transportation to an OR);

-   If a less extensive procedure fails, and a more extensive procedure
    is required, the second procedure is payable separately;

-   For certain services performed in a physician's office, separate
    payment can no longer be made for a surgical tray (code A4550). This
    code is now a Status B and is no longer a separately payable service
    on or after January 1, 2002. However, splints and casting supplies
    are payable separately under the reasonable charge payment
    methodology;

-   Immunosuppressive therapy for organ transplants; and

-   Critical care services (CPT codes 99291 and 99292) unrelated to the
    surgery, for example, where a seriously injured or burned patient is
    critically ill and requires constant attendance of the physician.
    See section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter for further discussion of
    critical care visits unrelated to the procedure with a global
    surgical period.

### Minor Surgeries and Endoscopies

> Visits by the same physician on the same day as a minor surgery or
> endoscopy are included in the payment for the procedure, unless a
> significant, separately identifiable service is also performed. For
> example, a visit on the same day could be properly billed in addition
> to suturing a scalp wound if a full neurological examination is made
> for a patient with head trauma. Billing for a visit would not be
> appropriate if the physician only identified the need for sutures and
> confirmed allergy and immunization status.
>
> A postoperative period of 10 days applies to some minor surgeries. The
> postoperative period for these procedures is indicated in Field 16 of
> the MFSDB. If the Field 16 entry is 010, A/B MACs (B) do not allow
> separate payment for postoperative visits or services within 10 days
> of the surgery that are related to recovery from the procedure. If a
> diagnostic biopsy with a 10- day global period precedes a major
> surgery on the same day or in the 10-day period, the major surgery is
> payable separately. Services by other physicians are not included in
> the global fee for a minor procedures except as otherwise excluded. If
> the Field 16 entry is 000, postoperative visits beyond the day of the
> procedure are not included in the payment amount for the surgery.
> Separate payment is made in this instance.
>
> See section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter for further discussion of
> critical care visits unrelated to the procedure with a global surgical
> period.

### Physicians Furnishing Less Than the Full Global Package B3-4820-4831

> There are occasions when more than one physician provides services
> included in the global surgical package. It may be the case that the
> physician who performs the surgical procedure does not furnish the
> follow-up care. Payment for the postoperative, post-discharge care is
> split between two or more physicians where the physicians agree on the
> transfer of care.
>
> When more than one physician furnishes services that are included in
> the global surgical package, the sum of the amount approved for all
> physicians may not exceed what would have been paid if a single
> physician provides all services (except where stated policies, e.g.,
> the surgeon performs only the surgery and a physician other than the
> surgeon provides preoperative and postoperative inpatient care, result
> in payment that is higher than the global allowed amount).
>
> Where a transfer of care does not occur, the services of another
> physician may either be paid separately or denied for medical
> necessity reasons, depending on the circumstances of the case.

### Determining the Duration of a Global Period

> To determine the global period for major surgeries, A/B MACs (B) count
> 1 day immediately before the day of surgery, the day of surgery, and
> the 90 days immediately following the day of surgery.

### EXAMPLE:

> Date of surgery - January 5 Preoperative period - January 4
>
> Last day of postoperative period - April 5
>
> To determine the global period for minor procedures, A/B MACs (B)
> count the day of surgery and the appropriate number of days
> immediately following the date of surgery.

### EXAMPLE:

> Procedure with 10 follow-up days: Date of surgery - January 5
>
> Last day of postoperative period - January 15

> included in the global package, the following procedures apply.

> Use of the modifiers in this section apply to both major procedures
> with a 90-day postoperative period and minor procedures with a 10-day
> postoperative period (and/or a zero day postoperative period in the
> case of modifiers "-22" and "-25").

### Physicians Who Furnish the Entire Global Surgical Package

> Physicians who perform the surgery and furnish all of the usual
> pre-and postoperative work bill for the global package by entering the
> appropriate CPT code for the surgical procedure only.
>
> Billing is not allowed for visits or other services that are included
> in the global package.

### Physicians in Group Practice

> When different physicians in a group practice participate in the care
> of the patient, the group bills for the entire global package if the
> physicians reassign benefits to the group. The physician who performs
> the surgery is shown as the performing physician. (For dates of
> service prior to January 1, 1994, however, where a new physician
> furnishes the entire postoperative care, the group billed for the
> surgical care and the postoperative care as separate line items with
> the appropriate modifiers.)

### Physicians Who Furnish Part of a Global Surgical Package

> Where physicians agree on the transfer of care during the global
> period, the following modifiers are used:

-   "-54" for surgical care only; or

-   "-55" for postoperative management only.

> Both the bill for the surgical care only and the bill for the
> postoperative care only, will contain the same date of service and the
> same surgical procedure code, with the services distinguished by the
> use of the appropriate modifier.
>
> Providers need not specify on the claim that care has been
> transferred. However, the date on which care was relinquished or
> assumed, as applicable, must be shown on the claim. This should be
> indicated in the remarks field/free text segment on the claim
> form/format**.** Both the surgeon and the physician providing the
> postoperative care must keep a copy of the written transfer agreement
> in the beneficiary's medical record.
>
> Where a transfer of postoperative care occurs, the receiving physician
> cannot bill for any part of the global services until he/she has
> provided at least one service. Once the physician has seen the
> patient, that physician may bill for the period beginning with the
> date on which he/she assumes care of the patient.

### EXCEPTIONS:

-   Where a transfer of care does not occur, occasional post-discharge
    services of a physician other than the surgeon are reported by the
    appropriate evaluation and management code. No modifiers are
    necessary on the claim.

-   If the transfer of care occurs immediately after surgery, the
    physician other than the surgeon who provides the in-hospital
    postoperative care bills using subsequent hospital

> care codes for the inpatient hospital care and the surgical code with
> the "-55" modifier for the post-discharge care. The surgeon bills the
> surgery code with the "-54" modifier.

-   Physicians who provide follow-up services for minor procedures
    performed in emergency departments bill the appropriate level of
    office visit code. The physician who performs the emergency room
    service bills for the surgical procedure without a modifier.

-   If the services of a physician other than the surgeon are required
    during a postoperative period for an underlying condition or medical
    complication, the other physician reports the appropriate evaluation
    and management code. No modifiers are necessary on the claim. An
    example is a cardiologist who manages underlying cardiovascular
    conditions of a patient.

### Evaluation and Management Service Resulting in the Initial Decision to Perform Surgery

> Evaluation and management services on the day before major surgery or
> on the day of major surgery that result in the initial decision to
> perform the surgery are not included in the global surgery payment for
> the major surgery and, therefore, may be billed and paid separately.
>
> In addition to the CPT evaluation and management code, modifier "-57"
> (decision for surgery) is used to identify a visit which results in
> the initial decision to perform surgery. (Modifier "- QI" was used for
> dates of service prior to January 1, 1994.)
>
> If evaluation and management services occur on the day of surgery, the
> physician bills using modifier "-57," not "-25." The "-57" modifier is
> not used with minor surgeries because the global period for minor
> surgeries does not include the day prior to the surgery. Moreover,
> where the decision to perform the minor procedure is typically done
> immediately before the service, it is considered a routine
> preoperative service and a visit or consultation is not billed in
> addition to the procedure.

### Return Trips to the Operating Room During the Postoperative Period

> When treatment for complications requires a return trip to the
> operating room, physicians must bill the CPT code that describes the
> procedure(s) performed during the return trip. If no such code exists,
> use the unspecified procedure code in the correct series, i.e., 47999
> or 64999. The procedure code for the original surgery is not used
> except when the **identical** procedure is repeated.
>
> In addition to the CPT code, physicians use CPT modifier "-78" for
> these return trips (return to the operating room for a related
> procedure during a postoperative period.)
>
> The physician may also need to indicate that another procedure was
> performed during the postoperative period of the initial procedure.
> When this subsequent procedure is related to the first procedure and
> requires the use of the operating room, this circumstance may be
> reported by adding the modifier "-78" to the related procedure.
>
> **NOTE:** The CPT definition for this modifier does not limit its use
> to treatment for complications.

### Staged or Related Procedures

> Modifier "-58" was established to facilitate billing of staged or
> related surgical procedures done during the postoperative period of
> the first procedure. This modifier is not used to report the treatment
> of a problem that requires a return to the operating room.
>
> The physician may need to indicate that the performance of a procedure
> or service during the postoperative period was:

a.  Planned prospectively or at the time of the original procedure;

b.  More extensive than the original procedure; or

c.  For therapy following a diagnostic surgical procedure.

> These circumstances may be reported by adding modifier "-58" to the
> staged procedure. A new postoperative period begins when the next
> procedure in the series is billed.

### Unrelated Procedures or Visits During the Postoperative Period

> Modifiers were established to simplify billing for visits and other
> procedures which are furnished during the postoperative period of a
> surgical procedure, but which are not included in the payment for the
> surgical procedure.
>
> **Modifier "-79":** Reports an unrelated procedure by the same
> physician during a postoperative period. The physician may need to
> indicate that the performance of a procedure or service during a
> postoperative period was unrelated to the original procedure.
>
> A new postoperative period begins when the unrelated procedure is
> billed.
>
> **Modifier "-24":** Reports an unrelated evaluation and management
> service by same physician during a postoperative period. The physician
> may need to indicate that an evaluation and management service was
> performed during the postoperative period of an unrelated procedure.
> This circumstance is reported by adding the modifier "-24" to the
> appropriate level of evaluation and management service.
>
> Services submitted with the "-24" modifier must be sufficiently
> documented to establish that the visit was unrelated to the surgery. A
> diagnosis code that clearly indicates that the reason for the
> encounter was unrelated to the surgery is acceptable documentation.
>
> A physician who is responsible for postoperative care and has reported
> and been paid using modifier "-55" also uses modifier "-24" to report
> any unrelated visits.
>
> For critical care visits that are unrelated to the surgical procedure
> and performed postoperatively, report modifier --FT as discussed in
> section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter.

### Significant Evaluation and Management on the Day of a Procedure

> Modifier "-25" is used to facilitate billing of evaluation and
> management services on the day of a procedure for which separate
> payment may be made.
>
> It is used to report a significant, separately identifiable evaluation
> and management service by same physician on the day of a procedure.
> The physician may need to indicate that on the day a procedure or
> service that is identified with a CPT code was performed, the
> patient's condition required a significant, separately identifiable
> evaluation and management service above and beyond the usual
> preoperative and postoperative care associated with the procedure or
> service that was performed. This circumstance may be reported by
> adding the modifier "-25" to the appropriate level of evaluation and
> management service.
>
> Claims containing evaluation and management codes with modifier "-25"
> are not subject to prepayment review except in the following
> situations:

-   Effective January 1, 1995, all evaluation and management services
    provided on the same day as inpatient dialysis are denied without
    review with the exception of CPT Codes 99221-9223, 99251-99255,
    and 99238. These codes may be billed with modifier

> "-25" and reviewed for possible allowance if the evaluation and
> management service is unrelated to the treatment of ESRD and was not,
> and could not, have been provided during the dialysis treatment;

-   When preoperative critical care codes are being billed within a
    global surgical period; and

    -   When A/B MACs (B) have conducted a specific medical review
        > process and determined, after reviewing the data, that an
        > individual or group has high statistics in terms of the use of
        > modifier "-25," have done a case-by-case review of the records
        > to verify that the use of modifier "-25" was inappropriate,
        > and have educated the individual or group as to the proper use
        > of this modifier.

> For critical care visits that are unrelated to the surgical procedure
> but performed on the same day, report modifier -FT as discussed in
> section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter for further discussion of critical
> care visits unrelated to the procedure with a global surgical period.

### Critical Care

> Critical care services provided during a global surgical period must
> be unrelated to a surgical procedure and appended with the modifier
> -FT. For further information see section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter for
> further discussion of critical care visits unrelated to the procedure
> with a global surgical period.

### Unusual Circumstances

> Surgeries for which services performed are significantly greater than
> usually required may be billed with the "-22" modifier added to the
> CPT code for the procedure. Surgeries for which services performed are
> significantly less than usually required may be billed with the "-52"
> modifier. The biller must provide:

-   A concise statement about how the service differs from the usual;
    > and

-   An operative report with the claim.

> Modifier "-22" should only be reported with procedure codes that have
> a global period of 0, 10, or 90 days. There is no such restriction on
> the use of modifier "-52."

### Date(s) of Service

> Physicians, who bill for the entire global surgical package or for
> only a portion of the care, must enter the date on which the surgical
> procedure was performed in the "From/To" date of service field. This
> will enable A/B MACs (B) to relate all appropriate billings to the
> correct surgery. Physicians who share postoperative management with
> another physician must submit additional information showing when they
> assumed and relinquished responsibility for the postoperative care. If
> the physician who performed the surgery relinquishes care at the time
> of discharge, he or she need only show the date of surgery when
> billing with modifier "-54."
>
> However, if the surgeon also cares for the patient for some period
> following discharge, the surgeon must show the date of surgery and the
> date on which postoperative care was relinquished to another
> physician. The physician providing the remaining postoperative care
> must show the date care was assumed. This information should be shown
> in Item 19 on the paper Form CMS-1500. See the related implementation
> guide for where to show this information on the ASC X12 837
> professional claim transaction format.

### Care Provided in Different Payment Localities

> If portions of the global period are provided in different payment
> localities, the services should be billed to the A/B MAC (B) servicing
> each applicable payment locality. For example, if the surgery is
> performed in one state and the postoperative care is provided in
> another state, the surgery is billed with modifier "-54" to the A/B
> MAC (B) servicing the payment locality where the surgery was performed
> and the postoperative care is billed with modifier "-55" to the A/B
> MAC (B) servicing the payment locality where the postoperative care
> was performed. This is true whether the services were performed by the
> same physician/group or different physicians/groups.

### Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA) Payments for Services Which Are Subject to the Global Surgery Rules

> HPSA bonus payments may be made for global surgeries when the services
> are provided in HPSAs. The following are guidelines for the
> appropriate billing procedures:

-   If the entire global package is provided in a HPSA, physicians
    should bill for the appropriate global surgical code with the
    applicable HPSA modifier.

-   If only a portion of the global package is provided in a HPSA, the
    physician should bill using a HPSA modifier for the portion which is
    provided in the HPSA.

### EXAMPLE

> The surgical portion of the global service is provided in a non-HPSA
> and the postoperative portion is provided in a HPSA. The surgical
> portion should be billed with the "-54" modifier and no HPSA modifier.
> The postoperative portion should be billed with the "-55" modifier and
> the appropriate HPSA modifier. The 10 percent bonus will be paid on
> the appropriate postoperative portion only. If a claim is submitted
> with a global surgical code and a HPSA modifier, the A/B MAC (B)
> assumes that the entire global service was provided in a HPSA in the
> absence of evidence otherwise.
>
> **NOTE:** The sum of the payments made for the surgical and
> postoperative services provided in different localities will not equal
> the global amount in either of the localities because of geographic
> adjustments made through the Geographic Practice Cost Indices.

# - Claims Review for Global Surgeries

### (Rev. 11287; Issued:03-02-22; Effective:01-01-22; Implementation: 02-22-22)

A.  **Relationship to Correct Coding Initiative (CCI)**

> The CCI policy and computer edits allow A/B MACs (B) to detect
> instances of fragmented billing for certain intra-operative services
> and other services furnished on the same day as the surgery that are
> considered to be components of the surgical procedure and, therefore,
> included in the global surgical fee. When both correct coding and
> global surgery edits apply to the same claim, A/B MACs (B) first apply
> the correct coding edits, then, apply the global surgery edits to the
> correctly coded services.

### Prepayment Edits to Detect Separate Billing of Services Included in the Global Package

> In addition to the correct coding edits, A/B MACs (B) must be capable
> of detecting certain other services included in the payment for a
> major or minor surgery or for an endoscopy. On a prepayment basis, A/B
> MACs (B) identify the services that meet the following conditions:

-   Preoperative services that are submitted on the same claim or on a
    subsequent claim as a surgical procedure; or

-   Same day or postoperative services that are submitted on the same
    claim or on a subsequent claim as a surgical procedure or endoscopy;

> and -

-   Services that were furnished within the prescribed global period of
    the surgical procedure;

-   Services that are billed without modifier "-78," "-79," "-24," "25,"
    or "-57" or are billed with modifier "-24" but without the required
    documentation; and

-   Services that are billed with the same provider or group number as
    the surgical procedure or endoscopy. Also, edit for any visits
    billed separately during the postoperative period without modifier
    "-24" by a physician who billed for the postoperative care only with
    modifier "-55."

> A/B MACs (B) use the following evaluation and management codes in
> establishing edits for visits included in the global package. CPT
> codes 99241, 99242, 99243, 99244, 99245, 99251,
>
> 99252, 99253, 99254, 99255, 99271, 99272, 99273, 99274, and 99275 have
> been transferred
>
> from the excluded category and are now included in the global surgery
> edits.

# - Adjudication of Claims for Global Surgeries

### (Rev. 11287; Issued:03-02-22; Effective:01-01-22; Implementation: 02-22-22)

A.  **Fragmented Billing of Services Included in the Global Package**

> Since the Medicare fee schedule amount for surgical procedures
> includes all services that are part of the global surgery package, A/B
> MACs (B) do not pay more than that amount when a bill is fragmented.
> When total charges for fragmented services exceed the global fee,
> process the claim as a fee schedule reduction (except where stated
> policies, e.g., the surgeon performs only the surgery and a physician
> other than the surgeon provides preoperative and postoperative
> inpatient care, result in payment that is higher than the global
> surgery allowed amount). A/B MACs (B) do not attribute such reductions
> to medical review savings except where the usual medical review
> process results in recoding of a service, and the recoded service is
> included in the global surgery package.
>
> The maximum a nonparticipating physician may bill a beneficiary on an
> unassigned claim for services included in the global surgery package
> is the limiting charge for the surgical procedure.
>
> In addition, the limitation of liability provision
> [[(§1879]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the
> Act) does not apply to these determinations since they are fee
> schedule reductions, not denials based upon medical necessity or
> custodial care.
>
> Claims for surgeries billed with a "-22" or "-52" modifier, are priced
> by individual consideration if the statement and documentation
> required by [§40.2.A.10]{.underline} are included. If the statement
> and documentation are not submitted with the claim, pricing for "-22"
> is it the fee schedule rate for the same surgery submitted without the
> "-22" modifier. Pricing for "-52" is not done without the required
> documentation.
>
> Separate payment is allowed for visits and procedures billed with
> modifier "-78," "-79," "-24," "-25," "-57," or "-58." Modifier "-24"
> must be accompanied by sufficient documentation that the visit is
> unrelated to the surgery.
>
> Critical care services furnished during the global period must be
> unrelated to the procedure. Separate payment is allowed for unrelated
> visits when the -FT modifier ((unrelated evaluation and management
> (E/M) visit on the same day as another E/M visit or during a global
> procedure (preoperative, postoperative period, or on the same day as
> the procedure, as applicable). (Report when an E/M visit is furnished
> within the global period but is unrelated, or when one or more
> additional E/M visits furnished on the same day are unrelated.)) is
> appended.
>
> See section 30.6.12.7 of this chapter for further discussion of
> critical care visits unrelated to the procedure with a global surgical
> period.
>
> A/B MACs (B) do not allow separate payment for evaluation and
> management services furnished on the same day or during the
> postoperative period of a surgery if the services are billed without
> modifier "-24," "-25," "-57" or "-FT". These services should be
> denied. A/B MACs (B) do not allow separate payment for visits during
> the postoperative period that are billed with the modifier "-24" or
> "-FT" but without sufficient documentation. These services should also
> be denied. Modifier "-24" or "-FT" is intended for use with services
> that are absolutely unrelated to the surgery. It is not to be used for
> the medical management of a patient by the surgeon following surgery.
> Recognize modifier "-24" only for care following discharge unless:

-   The care is for immunotherapy management furnished by the transplant
    surgeon;

-   The documentation demonstrates that the visit occurred during a
    subsequent hospitalization and the diagnosis supports the fact that
    it is unrelated to the original surgery.

> A/B MACs (B) do not allow separate payment for an additional
> procedure(s) with a global surgery fee period if furnished during the
> postoperative period of a prior procedure and if billed without
> modifier "-58," "-78," or "-79." These services should be denied.
> Codes with the global surgery indicator of "XXX" in the MFSDB can be
> paid separately without a modifier.

### Claims From Physicians Who Furnish Less Than the Global Package (Split Global Care)

> For surgeries performed January 1, 1992, and later, that are billed
> with either modifier "-54" or "-55," A/B MACs (B) pay the appropriate
> percentage of the fee schedule payment. Fields 17- 19 of the MFSDB
> list the appropriate percentages for pre-, intra-, and postoperative
> care of the total RVUs for major surgical procedures and for minor
> surgeries with a postoperative period of 10 days. The intra-operative
> percentage includes postoperative hospital visits.
>
> Procedures with a "000" entry in Field 16 have an entry of "0.0000" in
> Fields 17-19. Split global care does not apply to these procedures.
>
> A/B MACs (B) multiply the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or Field 35 of
> the MFSDB) by this percentage and round to the nearest cent. Assume
> that a physician who bills with a "-54" modifier has provided both
> preoperative, intra-operative and postoperative **hospital** services.
> Pay this physician the combined preoperative and intra-operative
> portions of the fee schedule payment amount.
>
> Where more than one physician bills for the postoperative care, A/B
> MACs (B) apportion the postoperative percentage according to the
> number of days each physician was responsible for the patient's care
> by dividing the postoperative allowed amount by the number of post-op
> days and that amount is multiplied by the number of days each
> physician saw the patient.

### EXAMPLE

> Dr. Jones bills for procedure "42145-54" performed on March 1 and
> states that he cared for the patient through April 29. Dr. Smith bills
> for procedure "42145-55" and states that she assumed care of the
> patient on April 30. The percentage of the total fee amount for the
> postoperative care for this procedure is determined to be 17 percent
> and the length of the global period is 90 days. Since Dr. Jones
> provided postoperative care for the first 60 days, he will receive 66
> 2/3 percent of the total fee of 17 percent since 60/90 = .6666. Dr.
> Smith's 30 days of service entitle her to 30/90 or .3333 of the fee.
>
> 6666 x .17 = .11333 or 11.3%; and
>
> 3338 x .17 = .057 or 5.7%.
>
> Thus, Dr. Jones will be paid at a rate of 11.3 percent (66.7 percent
> of 17 percent). Dr. Smith will be paid at a rate of 5.7 percent (33.3
> percent of 17 percent).

### Payment for Return Trips to the Operating Room for Treatment of Complications

> When a CPT code billed with modifier "-78" describes the services
> involving a return trip to the operating room to deal with
> complications, A/B MACs (B) pay the value of the intra- operative
> services of the code that describes the treatment of the

# - Claims for Multiple Surgeries

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**
>
> **B3-4826, B3-15038, B3-15056**

A.  **General**

> Multiple surgeries are separate procedures performed by a single
> physician or physicians in the same group practice on the same patient
> at the same operative session or on the same day for which separate
> payment may be allowed. Co-surgeons, surgical teams, or
> assistants-at-surgery may participate in performing multiple surgeries
> on the same patient on the same day.
>
> Multiple surgeries are distinguished from procedures that are
> components of or incidental to a primary procedure. These
> intra-operative services, incidental surgeries, or components of more
> major surgeries are not separately billable. See Chapter 23 for a
> description of mandatory edits to prevent separate payment for those
> procedures. Major surgical procedures are determined based on the
> MFSDB approved amount and not on the submitted amount from the
> providers.
>
> The major surgery, as based on the MFSDB, may or may not be the one
> with the larger submitted amount.
>
> Also, see subsection D below for a description of the standard payment
> policy on multiple surgeries. However, these standard payment rules
> are not appropriate for certain procedures. Field 21 of the MFSDB
> indicates whether the standard payment policy rules apply to a
> multiple surgery, or whether special payment rules apply. Site of
> service payment adjustments (codes with an indicator of "1" in Field
> 27 of the MFSDB) should be applied before multiple surgery payment
> adjustments.

### Billing Instructions

> The following procedures apply when billing for multiple surgeries by
> the same physician on the same day.

-   Report the more major surgical procedure without the multiple
    procedures modifier "- 51."

-   Report additional surgical procedures performed by the surgeon on
    the same day with modifier "-51."

> There may be instances in which two or more physicians each perform
> distinctly different, unrelated surgeries on the same patient on the
> same day (e.g., in some multiple trauma cases). When this occurs, the
> payment adjustment rules for multiple surgeries may not be
> appropriate. In such cases, the physician does not use modifier "-51"
> unless one of the surgeons individually performs multiple surgeries.

### A/B MAC (B) Claims Processing System Requirements

> A/B MACs (B) must be able to:

1.  Identify multiple surgeries by both of the following methods:

    -   The presence on the claim form or electronic submission of the
        > "-51" modifier; and

    -   The billing of more than one separately payable surgical
        > procedure by the same physician performed on the same patient
        > on the same day, whether on different lines or with a number
        > greater than 1 in the units column on the claim form or
        > inappropriately billed with modifier "-78" (i.e., after the
        > global period has expired);

2.  Access Field 34 of the MFSDB to determine the Medicare fee schedule
    payment amount for each surgery;

3.  Access Field 21 for each procedure of the MFSDB to determine if the
    payment rules for multiple surgeries apply to any of the multiple
    surgeries billed on the same day;

4.  If Field 21 for any of the multiple procedures contains an indicator
    of "0," the multiple surgery rules do not apply to that procedure.
    Base payment on the lower of the billed amount or the fee schedule
    amount (Field 34 or 35) for each code unless other payment
    adjustment rules apply;

5.  For dates of service prior to January 1, 1995, if Field 21 contains
    an indicator of "1," the standard rules for pricing multiple
    surgeries apply (see items 6-8 below);

6.  Rank the surgeries subject to the standard multiple surgery rules
    (indicator "1") in descending order by the Medicare fee schedule
    amount;

7.  Base payment for each ranked procedure on the lower of the billed
    amount, or:

    -   100 percent of the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or 35) for the
        > highest valued procedure;

    -   50 percent of the fee schedule amount for the second highest
        > valued procedure; and

    -   25 percent of the fee schedule amount for the third through the
        > fifth highest valued procedures;

8.  If more than five procedures are billed, pay for the first five
    according to the rules listed in 5, 6, and 7 above and suspend the
    sixth and subsequent procedures for manual review and payment, if
    appropriate, "by report." Payment determined on a "by report" basis
    for these codes should never be lower than 25 percent of the full
    payment amount;

9.  For dates of service on or after January 1, 1995, new standard rules
    for pricing multiple surgeries apply. If Field 21 contains an
    indicator of "2," these new standard rules apply (see items 10-12
    below);

10. Rank the surgeries subject to the multiple surgery rules (indicator
    "2") in descending order by the Medicare fee schedule amount;

11. Base payment for each ranked procedure (indicator "2") on the lower
    of the billed amount:

    -   100 percent of the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or 35) for the
        > highest valued procedure; and

    -   50 percent of the fee schedule amount for the second through the
        > fifth highest valued procedures; or

12. If more than five procedures with an indicator of "2" are billed,
    pay for the first five according to the rules listed in 9, 10, and
    11 above and suspend the sixth and subsequent procedures for manual
    review and payment, if appropriate, "by report." Payment determined
    on a "by report" basis for these codes should never be lower than 50
    percent of the full payment amount. Pay by the unit for services
    that are already reduced (e.g., 17003). Pay for 17340 only once per
    session, regardless of how many lesions were destroyed;

> **NOTE:** For dates of service prior to January 1, 1995, the multiple
> surgery indicator of "2" indicated that special dermatology rules
> applied. The payment rules for these codes have not changed. The rules
> were expanded, however, to all codes that previously had a multiple
> surgery indicator of "1." For dates of service prior to January 1,
> 1995, if a dermatological procedure with an indicator of "2" was
> billed with the "-51" modifier with other procedures that are **not**
> dermatological procedures (procedures with an indicator of "1" in
> Field 21), the standard multiple surgery rules applied. Pay no less
> than 50 percent for the dermatological procedures with an indicator of
> "2." See
>
> §§40.6.C.6-8 above for required actions.

13. If Field 21 contains an indicator of "3," and multiple endoscopies
    are billed, the special rules for multiple endoscopic procedures
    apply. Pay the full value of the highest valued endoscopy, plus the
    difference between the next highest and the base endoscopy. Access
    Field 31A of the MFSDB to determine the base endoscopy.

### EXAMPLE

> In the course of performing a fiber optic colonoscopy (CPT code
> 45378), a physician performs a biopsy on a lesion (code 45380) and
> removes a polyp (code 45385) from a different part of the colon. The
> physician bills for codes 45380 and 45385. The value of codes 45380
> and 45385 have the value of the diagnostic colonoscopy (45378) built
> in. Rather than paying 100 percent for the highest valued procedure
> (45385) and 50 percent for the next (45380), pay the full value of the
> higher valued endoscopy (45385), plus the difference between the next
> highest endoscopy (45380) and the base endoscopy (45378).
>
> A/B MACs (B) assume the following fee schedule amounts for these
> codes: 45378 - \$255.40
>
> 45380 - \$285.98
>
> 45385 - \$374.56
>
> Pay the full value of 45385 (\$374.56), plus the difference between
> 45380 and 45378 (\$30.58), for a total of \$405.14.
>
> **NOTE**: If an endoscopic procedure with an indicator of "3" is
> billed with the "-51" modifier with other procedures that are **not**
> endoscopies (procedures with an indicator of "1" in Field 21), the
> standard multiple surgery rules apply. See §§40.6.C.6-8 above for
> required actions.

14. Apply the following rules where endoscopies are performed on the
    same day as unrelated endoscopies or other surgical procedures:

    -   Two unrelated endoscopies (e.g., 46606 and 43217): Apply the
        > usual multiple surgery rules;

    -   Two sets of unrelated endoscopies (e.g., 43202 and 43217; 46606
        > and 46608): Apply the special endoscopy rules to each series
        > and then apply the multiple surgery rules. Consider the total
        > payment for each set of endoscopies as one service;

    -   Two related endoscopies and a third, unrelated procedure: Apply
        > the special endoscopic rules to the related endoscopies, and,
        > then apply the multiple surgery rules. Consider the total
        > payment for the related endoscopies as one service and the
        > unrelated endoscopy as another service.

15. If two or more multiple surgeries are of equal value, rank them in
    descending dollar order billed and base payment on the percentages
    listed above (i.e., 100 percent for the first billed procedure, 50
    percent for the second, etc.);

16. If any of the multiple surgeries are bilateral surgeries, consider
    the bilateral procedure at 150 percent as one payment amount, rank
    this with the remaining procedures, and apply the appropriate
    multiple surgery reductions. See
    [[§40.7]{.underline}](#claims-for-bilateral-surgeries) for bilateral
    surgery payment instructions.);

17. Round all adjusted payment amounts to the nearest cent;

18. If some of the surgeries are subject to special rules while others
    are subject to the standard rules, automate pricing to the extent
    possible. If necessary, price manually;

19. In cases of multiple interventional radiological procedures, both
    the radiology code and the primary surgical code are paid at 100
    percent of the fee schedule amount. The subsequent surgical
    procedures are paid at the standard multiple surgical percentages
    (50 percent, 50 percent, 50 percent and 50 percent);

20. Apply the requirements in [§§40]{.underline} on global surgeries to
    multiple surgeries;

21. Retain the "-51" modifier in history for any multiple surgeries paid
    at less than the full global amount; and

22. Follow the instructions on adjudicating surgery claims submitted
    with the "-22" modifier. Review documentation to determine if full
    payment should be made for those

> distinctly different, unrelated surgeries performed by different
> physicians on the same day.

# - Claims for Bilateral Surgeries

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-4827, B3-15040

A.  **General**

> Bilateral surgeries are procedures performed on both sides of the body
> during the same operative session or on the same day.
>
> The terminology for some procedure codes includes the terms
> "bilateral" (e.g., code 27395; Lengthening of the hamstring tendon;
> multiple, bilateral.) or "unilateral or bilateral" (e.g., code 52290;
> cystourethroscopy; with ureteral meatotomy, unilateral or bilateral).
> The payment adjustment rules for bilateral surgeries do not apply to
> procedures identified by CPT as "bilateral" or "unilateral or
> bilateral" since the fee schedule reflects any additional work
> required for bilateral surgeries.
>
> Field 22 of the MFSDB indicates whether the payment adjustment rules
> apply to a surgical procedure.

### Billing Instructions for Bilateral Surgeries

> If a procedure is not identified by its terminology as a bilateral
> procedure (or unilateral or bilateral), physicians must report the
> procedure with modifier "-50." They report such procedures as a single
> line item. (**NOTE**: This differs from the CPT coding guidelines
> which indicate that bilateral procedures should be billed as two line
> items.)
>
> If a procedure is identified by the terminology as bilateral (or
> unilateral or bilateral), as in codes 27395 and 52290, physicians do
> not report the procedure with modifier "-50."

### Claims Processing System Requirements

> A/B MACs (B) must be able to:

1.  Identify bilateral surgeries by the presence on the claim form or
    electronic submission of the "-50" modifier **or** of the same code
    on separate lines reported once with modifier "-LT" and once with
    modifier "-RT";

2.  Access Field 34 or 35 of the MFSDB to determine the Medicare payment
    amount;

3.  Access Field 22 of the MFSDB:

    -   If Field 22 contains an indicator of "0," "2," or "3," the
        > payment adjustment rules for bilateral surgeries do not apply.
        > Base payment on the lower of the billed amount or 100 percent
        > of the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or 35) unless other
        > payment adjustment rules apply.

> **NOTE:** Some codes which have a bilateral indicator of "0" in the
> MFSDB may be performed more than once on a given day. These are
> services that would never be considered bilateral and thus should not
> be billed with modifier "-50." Where such a code is billed on multiple
> line items or with more than 1 in the units field and A/B MACs (B)
> have determined that the code may be reported more than once, bypass
> the "0" bilateral indicator and refer to the multiple surgery field
> for pricing;

-   If Field 22 contains an indicator of "1," the standard adjustment
    > rules apply. Base payment on the lower of the billed amount or 150
    > percent of the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or 35). (Multiply the
    > payment amount in Field 34 or 35 for the surgery by 150 percent
    > and round to the nearest cent.)

4.  Apply the requirements [§§40 - 40.4]{.underline} on global surgeries
    to bilateral surgeries; and

5.  Retain the "-50" modifier in history for any bilateral surgeries
    paid at the adjusted amount.

> (**NOTE:** The "-50" modifier is not retained for surgeries which are
> bilateral by definition such as code 27395.)

# 40.8. - Claims for Co-Surgeons and Team Surgeons

### (Rev. 3721, Issued: 02-24-17, Effective: 05-25-17, Implementation: 05-25-17)

A.  **General**

> Under some circumstances, the individual skills of two or more
> surgeons are required to perform surgery on the same patient during
> the same operative session. This may be required because of the
> complex nature of the procedure(s) and/or the patient's condition. In
> these cases, the additional physicians are not acting as
> assistants-at-surgery.

### Billing Instructions

> The following billing procedures apply when billing for a surgical
> procedure or procedures that required the use of two surgeons or a
> team of surgeons:

-   If two surgeons (each in a different specialty) are required to
    perform a specific procedure, each surgeon bills for the procedure
    with a modifier "-62." Co-surgery also refers to surgical procedures
    involving two surgeons performing the parts of the procedure
    simultaneously, i.e., heart transplant or bilateral knee
    replacements. Documentation of the medical necessity for two
    surgeons is required for certain services identified in the MFSDB.
    (See [§40.8.C.5]{.underline}.);

-   If a team of surgeons (more than 2 surgeons of different
    specialties) is required to perform a specific procedure, each
    surgeon bills for the procedure with a modifier "-66." Field 25 of
    the MFSDB identifies certain services submitted with a "-66"

> modifier which must be sufficiently documented to establish that a
> team was medically necessary. All claims for team surgeons must
> contain sufficient information to allow pricing "by report."

-   If surgeons of different specialties are each performing a different
    procedure (with specific CPT codes), neither co-surgery nor multiple
    surgery rules apply (even if the procedures are performed through
    the same incision). If one of the surgeons performs multiple
    procedures, the multiple procedure rules apply to that surgeon's
    services. (See

> [§40.6]{.underline} for multiple surgery payment rules.)
>
> For co-surgeons (modifier 62), the fee schedule amount applicable to
> the payment for **each** co- surgeon is 62.5 percent of the global
> surgery fee schedule amount. Team surgery (modifier 66) is paid for on
> a "By Report" basis.

### Claims Processing System Requirements

> Carriers must be able to:

1.  Identify a surgical procedure performed by two surgeons or a team of
    surgeons by the presence on the claim form or electronic submission
    of the "-62" or "-66" modifier;

2.  Access Field 34 or 35 of the MFSDB to determine the fee schedule
    payment amount for the surgery;

3.  Access Field 24 or 25, as appropriate, of the MFSDB. These fields
    provide guidance on whether two or team surgeons are generally
    required for the surgical procedure;

4.  If the surgery is billed with a "-62" or "-66" modifier and Field 24
    or 25 contains an indicator of "0," payment adjustment rules for two
    or team surgeons do not apply:

    -   Carriers pay the first bill submitted, and base payment on the
        > lower of the billed amount or 100 percent of the fee schedule
        > amount (Field 34 or 35) unless other payment adjustment rules
        > apply;

    -   Carriers deny bills received subsequently from other physicians
        > and use the appropriate MSN message in [§§40.8.D]{.underline}.
        > As these are medical necessity denials, the instructions in
        > the Program Integrity Manual regarding denial of unassigned
        > claims for medical necessity are applied;

5.  If the surgery is billed with a "-62" modifier and Field 24 contains
    an indicator of "1," suspend the claim for manual review of any
    documentation submitted with the claim. If the documentation
    supports the need for co-surgeons, base payment for each physician
    on the lower of the billed amount or 62.5 percent of the fee
    schedule amount (Field 34 or 35);

6.  If the surgery is billed with a "-62" modifier and Field 24 contains
    an indicator of "2," payment rules for two surgeons apply. Carriers
    base payment for each physician on the lower of the billed amount or
    62.5 percent of the fee schedule amount (Field 34 or 35);

7.  If the surgery is billed with a "-66" modifier and Field 25 contains
    an indicator of "1," carriers suspend the claim for manual review.
    If carriers determine that team surgeons were medically necessary,
    each physician is paid on a "by report" basis;

8.  If the surgery is billed with a "-66" modifier and Field 25 contains
    an indicator of "2," carriers pay "by report";

> **NOTE:** A Medicare fee may have been established for some surgical
> procedures that are billed with the "-66" modifier. In these cases,
> all physicians on the team must agree on the percentage of the
> Medicare payment amount each is to receive. If carriers receive a bill
> with a "-66" modifier after carriers have paid one surgeon the full
> Medicare payment amount (on a bill **without** the modifier), deny the
> subsequent claim.

9.  Apply the rules global surgical packages to each of the physicians
    participating in a co- or team surgery; and

10. Retain the "-62" and "-66" modifiers in history for any co- or team
    surgeries.

### Beneficiary Liability on Denied Claims for Assistant, Co- surgeon and Team Surgeons

> When the procedure is subject to the statutory restriction against

# 40.9 - Procedures Billed With Two or More Surgical Modifiers

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-4829

> A/B MACs (B) may receive claims for surgical procedures with more than
> one surgical modifier. For example, since the global fee concept
> applies to all major surgeries, A/B MACs
>
> \(B\) may receive a claim for surgical care only (modifier "-54") for
> a bilateral surgery (modifier "-50"). They may also receive a claim
> for multiple surgeries requiring the use of an assistant surgeon.
>
> Following is a list of possible combinations of surgical modifiers.
>
> (**NOTE:** A/B MACs (B) must price all claims for surgical teams "by
> report.")

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and multiple surgery ("-51").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and surgical care only ("-54").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and postoperative care only (\"55").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and two surgeons ("-62").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and surgical team ("-66").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50") and assistant surgeon ("-80").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50"), two surgeons ("-62"), and surgical care
    only ("-54").

-   Bilateral surgery ("-50"), team surgery ("-66"), and surgical care
    only ("-54").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51") and surgical care only ("-54").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51") and postoperative care only (\"55").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51") and two surgeons ("-62").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51") and surgical team ("-66").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51") and assistant surgeon ("-80").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51"), two surgeons ("-62"), and surgical care
    only ("-54").

-   Multiple surgery ("-51"), team surgery ("-66"), and surgical care
    only ("-54").

-   Two surgeons ("-62") and surgical care only ("-54").

-   Two surgeons ("-62") and postoperative care only ("55").

-   Surgical team ("-66") and surgical care only ("-54").

-   Surgical team ("-66") and postoperative care only ("55").

> Payment is not generally allowed for an assistant surgeon when payment
> for either two surgeons (modifier "-62") or team surgeons (modifier
> "-66") is appropriate. If A/B MACs (B) receive a bill for an assistant

# 50 - Payment for Anesthesiology Services

### (Rev. 3747; Issued: 04-14-17; Effective: 01-01-17; Implementation: 05-15-17)

A.  **General Payment Rule**

> The fee schedule amount for physician anesthesia services furnished
> is, with the exceptions noted, based on allowable base and time units
> multiplied by an anesthesia conversion factor specific to that
> locality. The base unit for each anesthesia procedure is communicated
> to the A/B MACs by means of the HCPCS file released annually. CMS
> releases the conversion factor annually. The base units and conversion
> factor are available on the CMS website at:
> https[://w](http://www.cms.gov/Center/Provider-Type/Anesthesiologists-Center.html)ww.[cms.gov/Center/Provider-Type/Anesthesiologists-Center.html.](http://www.cms.gov/Center/Provider-Type/Anesthesiologists-Center.html)

### Payment at Personally Performed Rate

> The A/B MAC must determine the fee schedule payment, recognizing the
> base unit for the anesthesia code and one time unit per 15 minutes of
> anesthesia time if:

-   The physician personally performed the entire anesthesia service
    alone;

-   The physician is involved with one anesthesia case with a resident,
    the physician is a teaching physician as defined in
    [§100]{.underline};

-   The physician is involved in the training of physician residents in
    a single anesthesia case, two concurrent anesthesia cases involving
    residents or a single anesthesia case involving a resident that is
    concurrent to another case that meets the requirements for payment
    at the medically directed rate. The physician meets the teaching
    physician criteria in §100.1.4;

-   The physician is continuously involved in a single case involving a
    student nurse anesthetist;

-   If the physician is involved with a single case with a qualified
    nonphysician anesthetist (a certified registered nurse anesthetist
    (CRNA) or an anesthesiologist's assistant)), A/B MACs may pay the
    physician service and the qualified nonphysician anesthetist service
    in accordance with the requirements for payment at the medically
    directed rate;

> Or

-   The physician and the CRNA (or anesthesiologist's assistant) are
    involved in one anesthesia case and the services of each are found
    to be medically necessary. Documentation must be submitted by both
    the CRNA and the physician to support payment of the full fee for
    each of the two providers. The physician reports the AA modifier and
    the CRNA reports the QZ modifier.

### Payment at the Medically Directed Rate

> The A/B MAC determines payment at the medically directed rate for the
> physician on the basis of 50 percent of the allowance for the service
> performed by the physician alone. Payment will be made at the
> medically directed rate if the physician medically directs qualified
> individuals (all of whom could be CRNAs, anesthesiologists'
> assistants, interns, residents, or combinations of these individuals)
> in two, three, or four concurrent cases and the physician performs the
> following activities.

-   Performs a pre-anesthetic examination and evaluation;

-   Prescribes the anesthesia plan;

-   Personally participates in the most demanding procedures in the
    anesthesia plan, including, if applicable, induction and emergence;

-   Ensures that any procedures in the anesthesia plan that he or she
    does not perform are performed by a qualified individual;

-   Monitors the course of anesthesia administration at frequent
    intervals;

-   Remains physically present and available for immediate diagnosis and
    treatment of emergencies; and

-   Provides indicated post-anesthesia care.

> The physician must document in the medical record that he or she
> performed the pre-anesthetic examination and evaluation. Physicians
> must also document that they provided indicated post- anesthesia care,
> were present during some portion of the anesthesia monitoring, and
> were present during the most demanding procedures in the anesthesia
> plan, including induction and emergence, where indicated.
>
> NOTE: Concurrency refers to to the maximum number of procedures that
> the physician is medically directing within the context of a single
> procedure and whether these other procedures overlap each other.
> Concurrency is not dependent on each of the cases involving a Medicare
> patient. For example, if an anesthesiologist medically directs three
> concurrent procedures, two of which involve non-Medicare patients and
> the remaining a Medicare patient, this represents three concurrent
> cases.
>
> The requirements for payment at the medically directed rate also apply
> to cases involving student nurse anesthetists if the physician
> medically directs two concurrent cases, with each of the two cases
> involving a student nurse anesthetist, or the physician directs one
> case involving a student nurse anesthetist and another involving a
> qualified individual (for example: CRNA, anesthesiologist's assistant,
> intern or resident).
>
> The requirements for payment at the medically directed rate do not
> apply to a single resident case that is concurrent to another
> anesthesia case paid at the medically directed rate or to two
> concurrent anesthesia cases involving residents.
>
> If anesthesiologists are in a group practice, one physician member may
> provide the pre- anesthesia examination and evaluation while another
> fulfills the other criteria. Similarly, one physician member of the
> group may provide post-anesthesia care while another member of the
> group furnishes the other component parts of the anesthesia service.
> However, the medical record must indicate that the services were
> furnished by physicians and identify the physicians who furnished
> them.
>
> A physician who is concurrently furnishing services that meet the
> requirements for payment at the medically directed rate cannot
> ordinarily be involved in furnishing additional services to other
> patients. However, addressing an emergency of short duration in the
> immediate area, administering an epidural or caudal anesthetic to ease
> labor pain, periodic (rather than continuous) monitoring of an
> obstetrical patient, receiving patients entering the operating suite
> for the next surgery, checking or discharging patients in the recovery
> room, or handling scheduling matters, do not substantially diminish
> the scope of control exercised by the physician and do not constitute
> a separate service for the purpose of determining whether the
> requirements for payment at the medically directed rate are met.
>
> However, if the physician leaves the immediate area of the operating
> suite for other than short durations or devotes extensive time to an
> emergency case or is otherwise not available to respond to the
> immediate needs of the surgical patients, the physician's services to
> the surgical patients would not meet the requirements for payment at
> the medically directed rate. A/B MACs may not make payment under the
> feeschedule.

### Payment at Medically Supervised Rate

> The A/B MAC may allow only three base units per procedure when the
> anesthesiologist is involved in furnishing more than four procedures
> concurrently or is performing other services
>
> while directing the concurrent procedures. An additional time unit may
> be recognized if the physician can document he or she was present at
> induction.

### Billing and Payment for Multiple Anesthesia Procedures

> Physicians bill for the anesthesia services associated with multiple
> bilateral surgeries by reporting the anesthesia procedure with the
> highest base unit value with the multiple procedure modifier -51. They
> report the total time for all procedures in the line item with the
> highest base unit value.
>
> If the same anesthesia CPT code applies to two or more of the surgical
> procedures, billers enter the anesthesia code with the -51 modifier
> and the number of surgeries to which the modified CPT code applies.
>
> Payment can be made under the fee schedule for anesthesia services
> associated with multiple surgical procedures or multiple bilateral
> procedures. Payment is determined based on the base unit of the
> anesthesia procedure with the highest base unit value and time units
> based on the actual anesthesia time of the multiple procedures. See
>
> [§§40.6-40.7]{.underline} for billing and claims processing
> instructions for multiple and bilateral surgeries.

### Payment for Medical and Surgical Services Furnished in Addition to Anesthesia Procedure

> Payment may be made under the fee schedule for specific medical and
> surgical services furnished by the anesthesiologist as long as these
> services are reasonable and medically necessary or provided that other
> rebundling provisions (see [§30]{.underline} and Chapter 23) do not
> preclude separate payment. These services may be furnished in
> conjunction with the anesthesia procedure to the patient or may be
> furnished as single services, e.g., during the day of or the day
> before the anesthesia service. These services include the insertion of
> a Swan Ganz catheter, the insertion of central venous pressure lines,
> emergency intubation, and critical care visits.

### Anesthesia Time and Calculation of Anesthesia Time Units

> Anesthesia time is defined as the period during which an anesthesia
> practitioner is present with the patient. It starts when the
> anesthesia practitioner begins to prepare the patient for anesthesia
> services in the operating room or an equivalent area and ends when the
> anesthesia practitioner is no longer furnishing anesthesia services to
> the patient, that is, when the patient may be placed safely under
> postoperative care. Anesthesia time is a continuous time period from
> the start of anesthesia to the end of an anesthesia service. In
> counting anesthesia time for services furnished, the anesthesia
> practitioner can add blocks of time around an interruption in
> anesthesia time as long as the anesthesia practitioner is furnishing
> continuous anesthesia care within the time periods around the
> interruption.
>
> Actual anesthesia time in minutes is reported on the claim. For
> anesthesia services furnished, the A/B MAC computes time units by
> dividing reported anesthesia time by 15 minutes. Round the time unit
> to one decimal place. The A/B MAC does not recognize time units for
> CPT code 01996 (daily hospital management of epidural or subarachnoid
> continuous drug administration).
>
> For purposes of this section, anesthesia practitioner means:

-   a physician who performs the anesthesia service alone,

-   a CRNA who is furnishing services that do not meet the requirements
    for payment at the medically directed rate,

-   a qualified nonphysician anesthetist who is furnishing services that
    meet the requirements for payment at the medically directed rate.

> The physician who medically directs the qualified nonphysician
> anesthetist would ordinarily report the same time as the qualified
> nonphysician anesthetist reports for the service.

### Monitored Anesthesia Care

> Monitored anesthesia care involves the intra-operative monitoring by a
> physician or qualified individual under the medical direction of a
> physician or of the patient's vital physiological signs in
> anticipation of the need for administration of general anesthesia or
> of the development of adverse physiological patient reaction to the
> surgical procedure. It also includes the performance of a
> pre-anesthetic examination and evaluation, prescription of the
> anesthesia care required, administration of any necessary oral or
> parenteral medications (e.g., atropine, demerol, valium) and provision
> of indicated postoperative anesthesia care.
>
> The A/B MAC pays for reasonable and medically necessary monitored
> anesthesia care services on the same basis as other anesthesia
> services. If the physician personally performs the monitored
> anesthesia care case, payment is made under the fee schedule using the
> payment rules for payment at the personally performed rate. If the
> physician medically directs four or fewer concurrent cases and
> monitored anesthesia care represents one or more of these concurrent
> cases, payment is made under the fee schedule using the payment rules
> for payment at the medically directed rate. Anesthesiologists use the
> QS modifier to report monitored anesthesia care cases, in addition to
> reporting the actual anesthesia time and one of the payment modifiers
> on the claim.

### Anesthesia Claims Modifiers

> Physicians report the appropriate modifier to denote whether the
> service meets the requirements for payment at the personally performed
> rate, medically directed rate, or medically supervised rate.
>
> **AA -** Anesthesia Services performed personally by the
> anesthesiologist
>
> **AD -** Medical Supervision by a physician; more than 4 concurrent
> anesthesia procedures
>
> **G8 -** Monitored anesthesia care (MAC) for deep complex,
> complicated, or markedly invasive surgical procedures
>
> **G9 -** Monitored anesthesia care for patient who has a history of
> severe cardio- pulmonary condition
>
> **QK -** Medical direction of two, three or four concurrent anesthesia
> procedures involving qualified individuals
>
> **QS -** Monitored anesthesia care service
>
> NOTE: The QS modifier can be used by a physician or a qualified
> nonphysician anesthetist and is for informational purposes. Providers
> must report actual anesthesia time and one of the payment modifiers on
> the claim.
>
> **QY -** Medical direction of one qualified nonphysician anesthetist
> by an anesthesiologist
>
> **GC -** These services have been performed by a resident under the
> direction of a teaching physician.
>
> NOTE: The GC modifier is reported by the teaching physician to
> indicate he/she rendered the service in compliance with the teaching
> physician requirements in §100 of this chapter. One of the payment
> modifiers must be used in conjunction with the GC modifier.
>
> The A/B MAC must determine payment for anesthesia in accordance with
> these instructions. They must be able to determine the uniform base
> unit that is assigned to the anesthesia code and apply the appropriate
> reduction where the anesthesia procedure meets the requirements for
> payment at the medically directed rate. They must also be able to
> determine the number of
>
> anesthesia time units from actual anesthesia time reported on the
> claim. The A/B MAC must multiply allowable units by the
> anesthesia-specific conversion factor used to determine fee schedule
> payment for the payment area.

### Moderate Sedation Services Furnished in Conjunction with and in Support of Procedural Services

> Anesthesia services range in complexity. The continuum of anesthesia
> services, from least intense to most intense in complexity is as
> follows: local or topical anesthesia, moderate (conscious) sedation,
> regional anesthesia and general anesthesia. Moderate sedation is a
> drug induced depression of consciousness during which the patient
> responds purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or accompanied
> by light tactile stimulation. Moderate sedation does not include
> minimal sedation, deep sedation or monitored anesthesia care.
>
> Practitioners will report the appropriate CPT and/or HCPCS code that
> describes the moderate sedation services furnished during a patient
> encounter, which are furnished in conjunction with and in support of a
> procedural service, consistent with CPT guidance.
>
> Refer to §50 and §140 of this chapter for information regarding
> reporting of anesthesia services furnished in conjunction with and in
> support of procedural services.

### Anesthesia for Diagnostic or Therapeutic Nerve Blocks and Services Lower in Intensity than Moderate Sedation

> If the anesthesiologist or CRNA provides anesthesia for diagnostic or
> therapeutic nerve blocks or injections and a different provider
> performs the block or injection, then the anesthesiologist or CRNA may
> report the anesthesia service using the appropriate CPT code
> consistent with CPT guidance. The service must meet the criteria for
> monitored anesthesia care as described in this section. If the
> anesthesiologist or CRNA provides both the anesthesia service and the
> block or injection, then the anesthesiologist or CRNA may report the
> anesthesia service and the injection or block. However, the anesthesia
> service must meet the requirements for moderate sedation and if a
> lower level complexity anesthesia service is provided, then the
> moderate sedation code should not be reported.
>
> If the physician performing the medical or surgical procedure also
> provides a level of anesthesia lower in intensity than moderate
> sedation, such as a local or topical anesthesia, then the moderate
> sedation code should not be reported and no separate payment should be
> allowed by the A/B MAC.

# 60 - Payment for Pathology Services

### (Rev. 2714, Issued: 05-24-13, Effective: 07-01-12 Implementation: 06-25, 13)

A.  **Payment for Professional Component (PC) Services**

> Payment may be made under the physician fee schedule for the
> professional component of physician laboratory or physician pathology
> services furnished to hospital inpatients or outpatients by hospital
> physicians or by independent laboratories, if they qualify as the re-
> assignee for the physician service.

B.  ### Payment for Technical Component (TC) Services

    1.  General Rule

> Payment is not made under the physician fee schedule for TC services
> furnished in institutional settings where the TC service is bundled
> into the facility payment, e.g., hospital inpatient and outpatient
> settings. Payment is made under the physician fee schedule for TC
> services furnished in institutional settings where the TC service is
> not
>
> bundled into the facility payment, e.g., an ambulatory surgery center
> (ASC). Payment may be made under the physician fee schedule for the TC
> of physician pathology services furnished by an independent
> laboratory, or a hospital if it is acting as an independent
> laboratory, to non-hospital patients. The physician fee schedule
> identifies physician laboratory or physician pathology services that
> have a TC service.

2.  TC Services Furnished by Independent Laboratories to Hospital
    Inpatients and Outpatients

    -   For services furnished on or after July 1, 2012, an independent
        > laboratory may not bill the A/B MAC (B) (and the A/B MAC (B)
        > may not pay) for the TC of a physician pathology service
        > furnished to a hospital inpatient or outpatient.

    -   For services furnished prior to July 1, 2012, payment may be
        > made under the fee schedule, as noted below, for the (TC) of
        > pathology services furnished by an independent laboratory to
        > hospital inpatients or outpatients.

> CMS published a final regulation in 1999 that would no longer allow
> independent laboratories to bill under the physician fee schedule for
> the TC of physician pathology services. The implementation of this
> regulation was delayed by Section 542 of the Benefits and Improvement
> and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA). Section 542 allows the Medicare A/B
> MAC (B) to continue to pay for the TC of physician pathology services
> when an independent laboratory furnishes this service to an inpatient
> or outpatient of a covered hospital. This provision is applicable to
> TC services furnished January 1, 2001 through June 30, 2012.
>
> For this provision, a covered hospital is a hospital that had an
> arrangement with an independent laboratory that was in effect as of
> July 22, 1999, under which a laboratory furnished the TC of physician
> pathology services to fee-for-service Medicare beneficiaries who were
> hospital inpatients or outpatients, and submitted claims for payment
> for the TC to a A/B MAC (B). The TC could have been submitted
> separately or combined with the professional component and reported as
> a combined service.
>
> The term, fee-for-service Medicare beneficiary, means an individual
> who:

-   Is entitled to benefits under Part A or enrolled under Part B of
    > title XVIII or both; and

-   Is not enrolled in any of the following: A Medicare + Choice plan
    > under Part C of such title; a plan offered by an eligible
    > organization under §1876 of the Social Security Act; a program of
    > all-inclusive care for the elderly under §1894; or a social health
    > maintenance organization demonstration project established under
    > Section 4108 of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987.

> In implementing Section 542, the A/B MACs (B) should consider as
> independent laboratories those entities that it has previously
> recognized as independent laboratories.
>
> An independent laboratory that has acquired another independent
> laboratory that had an arrangement of July 22, 1999, with a covered
> hospital, can bill the TC of physician pathology services for that
> hospital's inpatients and outpatients under the physician fee
> schedule.
>
> An independent laboratory that furnishes the TC of physician pathology
> services to inpatients or outpatients of a hospital that is not a
> covered hospital may not bill the A/B MAC (B) for the TC of physician
> pathology services during the time §542 is in effect.
>
> If the arrangement between the independent laboratory and the covered
> hospital limited the provision of TC physician pathology services to
> certain situations or at particular times, then the independent
> laboratory can bill the A/B MAC (B) only for these limited services.
>
> The A/B MAC (B) shall require independent laboratories that had an
> arrangement, on or prior to July 22, 1999 with a covered hospital, to
> bill for the technical component of physician pathology services to
> provide a copy of this agreement, or other documentation
> substantiating that an arrangement was in effect between the hospital
> and the independent laboratory as of this date. The independent
> laboratory must submit this documentation for each covered hospital
> that the independent laboratory services.

### Physician Laboratory and Pathology Services

> Physician laboratory and pathology services are limited to:

-   Surgical pathology services;

-   Specific cytopathology, hematology and blood banking services that
    have been identified to require performance by a physician and are
    listed below;

-   Clinical consultation services that meet the requirements in
    subsection 3 below; and

-   Clinical laboratory interpretation services that meet the
    requirements and which are specifically listed in subsection 4
    below.

    1.  ### Surgical Pathology Services

> Surgical pathology services include the gross and microscopic
> examination of organ tissue performed by a physician, except for
> autopsies, which are not covered by Medicare.
>
> Depending upon circumstances and the billing entity, the A/B MACs (B)
> may pay professional component, technical component or both.

### Specific Hematology, Cytopathology and Blood Banking Services

> Cytopathology services include the examination of cells from fluids,
> washings, brushings or smears, but generally excluding hematology.
> Examining cervical and vaginal smears are the most common service in
> cytopathology. Cervical and vaginal smears do not require
> interpretation by a physician unless the results are or appear to be
> abnormal. In such cases, a physician personally conducts a separate
> microscopic evaluation to determine the nature of an abnormality. This
> microscopic evaluation ordinarily does require performance by a
> physician. When medically necessary and when furnished by a physician,
> it is paid under the fee schedule.
>
> For services furnished prior to January 1, 1999, A/B MACs (B) pay
> separately under the physician fee schedule for the interpretation of
> an abnormal pap smear furnished to a hospital inpatient by a
> physician. They must pay under the clinical laboratory fee schedule
> for pap smears furnished in all other situations. This policy also
> applies to screening pap smears requiring a physician interpretation.
> For services furnished on or after January 1, 1999, A/B MACs (B) allow
> separate payment for a physician's interpretation of a pap smear to
> any patient (i.e., hospital or non-hospital) as long as: (1) the
> laboratory's screening personnel suspect an abnormality; and (2) the
> physician reviews and interprets the pap smear.
>
> This policy also applies to screening pap smears requiring a physician
> interpretation and described in the National Coverage Determination
> Manual and Chapter 18. These services are reported under codes P3000
> or P3001.
>
> Physician hematology services include microscopic evaluation of bone
> marrow aspirations and biopsies. It also includes those limited number
> of peripheral blood smears which need to be referred to a physician to
> evaluate the nature of an apparent abnormality identified by the
> technologist. These codes include 85060, 38220, 85097, and 38221.
>
> A/B MACs (B) pay the PC for the interpretation of an abnormal blood
> smear (code 85060) furnished to a hospital inpatient by a hospital
> physician or an independent laboratory.
>
> For other hematology codes, payment may be made for the PC component
> if the service is furnished to a patient by a hospital physician or
> independent laboratory. In addition, payment may be made for these
> services furnished to patients by an independent laboratory.
>
> Blood banking services of hematologists and pathologists are paid
> under the physician fee schedule when analyses are performed on donor
> and/or patient blood to determine compatible donor units for
> transfusion where cross matching is difficult or where contamination
> with transmissible disease of donor is suspected.
>
> The blood banking codes are 86077, 86078, and 86079 and represent
> professional component only services.

### Clinical Consultation Services

> Clinical consultations are paid under the physician fee schedule only
> if they:

a.  Are requested by the patient's attending physician;

b.  Relate to a test result that lies outside the clinically significant
    normal or expected range in view of the condition of the patient;

c.  Result in a written narrative report included in the patient's
    medical record; and

d.  Require the exercise of medical judgment by the consultant
    physician.

> Clinical consultations are professional component services only, i.e.,
> there is no TC service. The clinical consultation codes are 80500 and
> 80502.
>
> Routine conversations held between a laboratory director and an
> attending physician about test orders or results do not qualify as
> consultations unless all four requirements are met.
>
> Laboratory personnel, including the director, may from time to time
> contact attending physicians to report test results or to suggest
> additional testing or be contacted by attending physicians on similar
> matters. These contacts do not constitute clinical consultations.
>
> However, if in the course of such a contact, the attending physician
> requests a consultation from the pathologist, and if that consultation
> meets the other criteria and is properly documented, it is paid under
> the fee schedule.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** A pathologist telephones a surgeon about a patient's
> suitability for surgery based on the results of clinical laboratory
> test results. During the course of their conversation, the surgeon
> asks the pathologist whether, based on test results, patient history
> and medical records, the patient is a candidate for surgery. The
> surgeon's request requires the pathologist to render a medical
> judgment and provide a consultation. The pathologist follows up
> his/her oral advice with a written report and the surgeon notes in the
> patient's medical record that he/she requested a consultation. This
> consultation is paid under the fee schedule.
>
> In any case, if the information could ordinarily be furnished by a
> nonphysician laboratory specialist, the service of the physician is
> not a consultation payable under the fee schedule.
>
> See the Program Integrity Manual for guidelines for related data
> analysis to identify inappropriate patterns of billing for
> consultations.

### Clinical Laboratory Interpretation Services

> Only clinical laboratory interpretation services, which meet the
> criteria in subsections C.3.a, c, and d, are billable under the
> physician fee schedule. These codes have a PC/TC indicator of "6" on
> the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule database. These services are
> reported under the clinical laboratory code with modifier 26. These
> services can be paid under the physician fee schedule if they are
> furnished to a patient by a hospital pathologist or an independent
> laboratory. Note that a hospital's standing order policy can be used
> as a substitute for the individual request by the patient's attending
> physician. A/B MACs (B) are not allowed to revise CMS's list to
> accommodate local medical practice. The CMS periodically reviews this
> list and adds or deletes clinical laboratory codes as warranted.

### Global Billing

> Billing globally for services that are split into separate PC and TC
> services is only possible when the PC and TC are furnished by the same
> physician or supplier entity. For example, where the PC and the TC of
> a diagnostic service are provided in the same service location, this
> is reflected as the address entered into Item 32 on CMS Form 1500,
> which provides the ZIP Code to pay the right locality/GPCI. In this
> case, the physician/entity may bill globally.
>
> However, if the PC and the TC are each provided in different service
> locations (enrolled practice locations), the PC and the TC must be
> separately billed.
>
> Merely applying the same place of service (POS) code to the PC and the
> TC does not permit global billing for any diagnostic procedure.

# - Services of Physicians Furnished in Providers or to Patients of Providers

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15014

> This section sets forth special conditions that govern payments for
> services that physicians furnish in, or to patients of, providers of
> services including hospitals, SNFs, or Comprehensive Outpatient
> Rehabilitation Facilities (CORFs). If physicians are compensated for
> their services by a provider or another entity, the compensation they
> receive must be allocated among the various types of services they
> furnish.
>
> The A/B MAC (A) pays for services that physicians furnish to the
> provider. Physician services to the provider include, but are not
> limited to, standby surgical services. Payment for physicians'
> services to individual patients that meet the conditions in subsection
> A is made under the physicians fee schedule. However:

-   Payment for physicians' services furnished in teaching settings is
    subject to the additional conditions in
    [[§100]{.underline}](#teaching-physician-services);

-   Payment for physicians' services furnished to ESRD patients is
    subject to additional requirements in Chapter 8, and

-   The A/B MAC (A) pays for the services of residents, as well as for
    physicians who are licensed to practice only in the provider
    setting, as provider services. (See
    [[§100.2]{.underline}](#interns-and-residents))

A.  ### Conditions for Physician Fee Schedule Payment for Physicians' Services to Patients in Providers

    1.  []{#_bookmark59 .anchor}**General**

> A/B MACs (B) pay for physicians' services to patients of providers on
> a fee schedule basis only if the following requirements are met:

-   The services are personally furnished for an individual patient by a
    physician;

-   The services contribute directly to the diagnosis or treatment or an
    individual patient;

-   The services ordinarily require performance by a physician; and

-   In the case of anesthesiology, radiology, or pathology/laboratory
    services, certain additional requirements in [§§50]{.underline},
    [[60]{.underline}](#payment-for-pathology-services), and
    [[70]{.underline}](#payment-conditions-for-radiology-services) are
    met.

### Services of Physicians to Patients in Providers

> If a physician furnishes services to a patient in a hospital or SNF
> that do not meet the requirements in
> [[§80.A.1]{.underline},](#_bookmark59) above, but are related to
> patient care, the services may be covered as provider services and
> paid by the A/B MAC (A) within the applicable Prospective Payment
> System (PPS) rate.

### Effect of Billing Charges for Physician Services to Provider

> If services furnished by a physician to a provider may be paid by the
> A/B MAC (A), neither the provider nor the physician may seek fee
> schedule payments from the A/B MAC (B), the beneficiary, or another
> insurer. A/B MACs (B) must report any situation in which this happens
> to the RO unless it is clearly an isolated case of billing error.

### Effect of Assumption of Operating Costs

> If a physician or an entity enters into an agreement (such as a lease
> or concession) with a provider under which the physician (or entity)
> assumes some or all of the operating costs of the provider department:

-   A/B MACs (B) make fee schedule payments only for physicians'
    services to individual patients;

-   The physician (or other entity) must make its books and records
    available to the provider and the A/B MAC (A), as necessary, to
    verify the nature and extent of the costs of the services furnished
    by the physician (or other entity); and

-   The lessee's costs associated with producing these services,
    including overhead, supplies, equipment, and the costs of employing
    nonphysician personnel are payable by the A/B MAC (A) as provider
    services.

# - Coverage of Physicians' Services Provided in Comprehensive Outpatient Rehabilitation Facility

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-2220

> Rehabilitation services furnished by comprehensive outpatient
> rehabilitation facilities (CORFs) are covered by Medicare Part B.
>
> Under §1832(a)(2)(E), and §1861(cc)(2) (go to
> [[http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm)
> and select the applicable title) and related provisions of the Act, a
> CORF is recognized as a provider of services on the basis of its
> reasonable costs. Except for diagnostic and therapeutic services
> provided by physicians to individual patients, payment is made to the
> CORF by A/B MACs (A) (acting in the role of the A/B MAC (B).)
>
> Physicians' diagnostic and therapeutic services furnished to a CORF
> patient are not considered CORF physician's services. Instead they are
> services that the physician must bill to the A/B MAC (B). If covered
> services, payment is made according to the Medicare Physician Fee
> Schedule. When physician's diagnostic and therapeutic services are
>
> furnished in a CORF, the claim must be annotated to show the CORF as
> the place of treatment.
>
> Services considered administrative services provided by the physician
> associated with the CORF are considered CORF services reimbursable to
> the CORF by the A/B MACs (A). Administrative services include
> consultation with and medical supervision of nonphysician staff,
> establishing and reviewing the plan of treatment, and other medical
> and facility administration activities.

# - Rural Health Clinic and Federally Qualified Health Center Services

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-2260-2260.3

> Payment may be made under Part B for the medical and other health
> services furnished by a qualified rural health clinic (RHC) and
> Federally qualified health centers (FQHCs). The covered services
> RHCs/FQHCs may offer are divided into two basic groups: RHC/FQHC
> services (defined below) and other medical and other health services
> covered under Part B.
>
> Items and services which meet the definition of RHC services or FQHC
> services are reimbursed either by designated RHC intermediaries, or a
> national FQHC FI in the case of independent RHCs/FQHCs, or by the
> provider's A/B MAC (A) in the case of provider based clinics. In
> either case, the A/B MAC (B) does not pay claims for services defined
> as RHC/FQHC services. The A/B MAC (A) pays for such services through a
> prospectively determined encounter rate.
>
> Where an RHC or a FQHC is approved for billing other medical and
> health services to the A/B MAC (B), the RHC or FQHC bills the A/B MAC
> (B) and is paid according to the method of payment for the service
> provided.
>
> Rural health clinic and Federally qualified health center services are
> described in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 13. That
> chapter provides that the following services usually performed by
> physicians are included as services included in the encounter rate and
> therefore are not separately billable for RHC/FQHC patients. They are:

-   Professional services performed by a physician for a patient
    including diagnosis, therapy, surgery, and consultation (See the
    Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15);

-   Services and supplies incident to a physician's services, as
    described in the Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15;

-   Nurse practitioner and physician assistant services (including the
    services of specialized nurse practitioners and nurse midwives) that
    would be covered if furnished by a physician, provided the nurse
    practitioner or physician assistant is legally permitted to perform
    the services by the State in which they are performed;

-   Services and supplies incident to the services of nurse
    practitioners and physician assistants that would be covered if
    furnished incident to a physician's services, and

-   Visiting nurse services to the homebound.

> However, the technical component of diagnostic services may be billed
> separately by the physician to the A/B MAC (B), if provided. See
> Chapter 9, and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 13, for
> additional information on the definition of RHC/FQHC services.
>
> Also, an RHC or FQHC may provide other items and services which are
> covered under Part B, but which are not defined as RHC or FQHC
> services. They are listed in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual,
> Chapter 13. Independent RHCs/FQHCs bill the A/B MAC (B) for such
> services. Provider-based RHC/FQHC services are billed to the A/B MAC
> (A) as services of the parent provider.
>
> Independent RHCs/FQHCs must enroll with the A/B MAC (B) in order to
> bill. (See the Medicare Program Integrity Manual, Chapter 10, for
> enrollment instructions).

# - Unusual Travel (CPT Code 99082)

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15026

> In general, travel has been incorporated in the MPFSDB individual fees
> and is thus not separately payable. A/B MACs (B) must pay separately
> for unusual travel (CPT code 99082) only when the physician submits
> documentation to demonstrate that the travel was very unusual.

# - Physicians Practicing in Special Settings

> **(Rev. 1, 10-01-03)**

# - Physicians in Federal Hospitals

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-2020.5

> There are many physicians performing services in hospitals operated by
> the Federal Government, e.g., military, Veterans Administration, and
> Public Health Service hospitals. Normally Medicare does not pay for
> the services provided by a physician in a Federal hospital except when
> the hospital provides services to the public generally as a community
> institution. Such a physician working in the scope of his Federal
> employment may be considered as coming within the statutory definition
> of physician even though he may not have a license to practice in the
> State in which he is employed.

# - Physician Billing for End-Stage Renal Disease Services

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 11, for a description
> of ESRD policy. See chapter 8, for billing requirements for physicians
> and facilities.

# - Inpatient Hospital Visits With Dialysis Patients

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03) B3-15062-15062.1

> Global billing practices that involve the submission of charges for
> each day that a patient is hospitalized are allowed. Therefore, A/B
> MACs (B) may make payment for inpatient hospital visits that are
> specified relative to time, place, day, and services directly provided
> to inpatients. This guideline may, however, differ with respect to
> daily visit charges for inpatient hospital visits with dialysis
> inpatients. When an ESRD patient is hospitalized, the hospitalization
> may or may not be due to a renal-related condition. In either case,
> the patient must continue to be dialyzed.
>
> Chapter 8 provides policy and payment instructions for physicians'
> services furnished to dialysis inpatients. It also provides
> instructions for billing physicians' renal-related medical services
> furnished on dialysis days and for dialysis and evaluation and
> management services performed on the same day.

# - Physicians' Services Performed in Ambulatory Surgical Centers (ASC)

### (Rev. 1604, Issued: 09-26-08, Effective: 01-08-08, Implementation: 01-05-09)

> See Chapter 14, for a description of services that may be billed by an
> ASC and services separately billed by physicians.
>
> The ASC payment does not include the professional services of the
> physician. These are billed separately by the physician. Physicians'
> services include the services of anesthesiologists administering or
> supervising the administration of anesthesia to ASC patients and the
> patients'
>
> recovery from the anesthesia. The term physicians' services also
> includes any routine pre- or postoperative services, such as office
> visits, consultations, diagnostic tests, removal of stitches, changing
> of dressings, and other services which the individual physician
> usually performs.
>
> The physician must enter the place of service code (POS) 24 on the
> claim to show that the procedure was performed in an ASC.
>
> The A/B MAC (B) pays the facility fee from the MPFSDB to the
> physician. The facility fee is for services done in a facility other
> than the physician's office and is typically less than the nonfacility
> fee for services performed in the physician's office.

# - Billing and Payment in a Health Professional Shortage Area (HPSA)

### (Rev. 1273; Issued: 06-29-07; Effective/Implementation Dates: 10-01-07)

> In accordance with
> [[§1833(m)]{.underline}](http://www.cms.hhs.gov/regulations/) of the
> Act, physicians who provide covered professional services in any rural
> or urban HPSA are entitled to an incentive payment. Beginning January
> 1, 1989, physicians providing services in certain classes of rural
> HPSAs were entitled to a 5-percent incentive payment. Effective
> January 1, 1991, physicians providing services in either rural or
> urban HPSAs are eligible for a 10-percent incentive payment.
>
> Eligibility for receiving the 10 percent bonus payment is based on
> whether the specific location at which the service is furnished is
> within an area that is designated (under section 332(a)(1)(A) of the
> Public Health Services Act) as a HPSA. The Health Resources and
> Services Administration (HRSA), within the Department of Health &
> Human Services, is responsible for designating shortage areas.
>
> HRSA designates three types of HPSAs: geographic, population, and
> facility-based. Geographic-based HPSAs are areas with shortages of
> primary care physicians, dentists or psychiatrists. Population-based
> HPSAs are designations based on underserved populations within an
> area. Facility-based HPSAs are designations based on a public or
> non-profit private facility that is providing services to an
> underserved area or population and has an insufficient capacity to
> meet their needs.
>
> Section 1833(m) of the Social Security Act (the Act) provides
> incentive payments for physicians who furnish services in areas
> designated as HPSAs under section 332 (a)(1)(A) of the Public Health
> Service (PHS) Act. This section of the PHS Act pertains to geographic-
> based HPSAs. Consequently, Medicare incentive payments are available
> only in geographic HPSAs.
>
> Although section 1833(m) of the Act provides the authority to
> recognize the three types of geographic-based HPSAs (primary medical
> care, dental and mental health), only physicians, including
> psychiatrists, furnishing services in a primary medical care HPSA are
> eligible to receive bonus payments. In addition, effective for claims
> with dates of service on or after July 1, 2004, psychiatrists
> furnishing services in mental health HPSAs are eligible to receive
> bonus payments. CMS does not recognize dental HPSAs for the bonus
> payment program.
>
> It is not enough for the physician merely to have his/her office or
> primary service location in a HPSA, nor must the beneficiary reside in
> a HPSA, although frequently this will be the case.
>
> The key to eligibility is where the service is actually provided
> (place of service). For example, a physician providing a service in
> his/her office, the patient's home, or in a hospital qualifies for the
> incentive payment as long as the specific location of the service is
> within an area designated as a HPSA. On the other hand, a physician
> may have an office in a HPSA but go outside the office (and the
> designated HPSA area) to provide the service. In this case, the
> physician would not be eligible for the incentive payment. A/B MAC (B)
> responsibilities include:
>
> Informing the physician community of these provisions;
>
> Providing a link to the CMS Web site to access the HPSA automated ZIP
> code files; Providing a direct link to HRSA's HPSA database
>
> Modifying the claims processing system to recognize and appropriately
> handle eligible claims;
>
> Paying physicians the incentive payments; and
>
> Performing post-payment reviews of samples of paid claims submitted
> using the AQ modifier.

A.  **General Overview**

> The HPSA physician bonus program guidelines are contained in Pub.
> 100-04, Chapter 12, §90.4. Refer to that section for payment and
> claims processing guidance for the HPSA physician bonus program that
> was established in 2005. The following guidelines pertain only to the
> additional 10 percent incentive payment for 10 - or 90 - day global
> surgical procedures furnished by 02 - general surgeons in HPSAs from
> January 1, 2011 through December 31, 2015.

> modifier -AQ on claims for 10 - or 90 - day global surgical procedures
> that were furnished in HPSAs approved by December 31 of the preceding
> calendar year, but that are not recognized for automatic payment. The

> be eligible for the 10 percent additional HSIP payment.

B.  ### Method of Payment

    -   Calculate and pay general surgeons an additional 10 percent
        > incentive payment;

    -   Calculate the payment based on the amount actually paid for the
        > service, not the Medicare approved amount;

    -   Combine the HSIP incentive payments, when appropriate, with
        > other incentive payments, including the HPSA physician bonus
        > payment;

    -   Accept and pay the incentive payment for 10 - and 90 - day
        > global period surgical procedures furnished by general
        > surgeons (02) and submitted with the modifier - AQ;

    -   Provide a special remittance form that is forwarded with the
        > incentive payment so that physicians and nonphysician
        > practitioners can identify which type of incentive payment
        > (HPSA, HSIP, and/or PCIP) was paid for which services;

    -   Use the PLB03 adjustment reason code LE;

    -   Add the following message to the incentive checks: This check is
        > for the HPSA, HSIP and/or PCIP. See special remittance for
        > details; and

    -   Inform practitioners to contact their A/B MAC (B) with any
        > questions regarding HSIP payments.

C.  ### Changes for A/B MAC (B) Systems

> The Medicare Carrier System, (MCS), Common Working File (CWF,) and
> National Claims History (NCH) shall be modified to accept a new
> incentive HPSA/PSA/HSIP/PCIP payment indicator on the claim line.
>
> Once the type of incentive has been identified by the shared systems,
> the shared system shall transmit the HPSA/PSA/HSIP/PCIP indicator to
> CWF and modify their systems to set the indicator on the claim line as
> follows:
>
> 1 = HPSA;
>
> 2 = PSA;
>
> 3 = HPSA and PSA;
>
> 4 = HSIP;
>
> 5 = HPSA and HSIP;
>
> 6 = PCIP;
>
> 7 = HPSA and PCIP; and
>
> Space = Not Applicable.
>
> The MCS shall send the HIGLAS 810 invoice for incentive payment
> invoices, including the new HSIP payment. The A/B MAC (B) shall also
> combine the practitioner's HPSA physician bonus, Physician Scarcity
> (PSA) bonus (if it should become available at a later date), HSIP
> payment, and/or PCIP payment invoice per practitioner. The A/B MAC (B)
> shall receive the HIGLAS 835 payment file from HIGLAS showing a single
> incentive payment per practitioner.

# - Bundling of Payments for Services Provided in Wholly Owned and Wholly Operated Entities (including Physician Practices and Clinics): 3-Day Payment Window

### (Rev. 2373, Issued: 12-21-11, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 01-03-12)

> In accordance with section 102(a)(1) of the PACMBPRA, for outpatient
> services furnished on or after June 25, 2010, the technical portion of
> all nondiagnostic services, other than ambulance and maintenance renal
> dialysis services, provided by the hospital (or an entity wholly owned
> or wholly operated by the hospital) on the date of a beneficiary's
> inpatient admission are deemed related to the admission and thus, must
> be included on the bill for the inpatient stay. Also, the technical
> portion of outpatient nondiagnostic services, other than ambulance and
> maintenance renal dialysis services, provided by the hospital (or an
> entity wholly owned or wholly operated by the hospital) on the first,
> second, and the third calendar days (1 calendar day for a
> nonsubsection (d) hospital) immediately preceding the date of
> admission are deemed related to the admission and, therefore, must be
> billed with the inpatient stay, unless the nondiagnostic services are
> unrelated to the inpatient hospital claim (that is, the preadmission
> nondiagnostic services are clinically distinct or independent from the
> reason for the beneficiary's inpatient admission). In such cases, the
> unrelated outpatient hospital nondiagnostic services are covered by
> Medicare Part B, and the hospital or wholly owned or wholly operated
> physician practice shall include the technical portion of the services
> in their billing. PACMBPRA did not change the requirement that the
> technical portion of all diagnostic services provided by the hospital
> (or entity wholly owned or wholly operated by the hospital) occurring
> on the date of an inpatient admission, or during the 3 calendar
>
> days (or 1 calendar day) immediately preceding the date of an
> inpatient admission must be billed with the inpatient admission.

### Implementation of the 3-day Payment Window Policy in Wholly Owned or Operated Entities

> Wholly owned or wholly operated entities are subject to the 3-day (or
> 1-day) payment window policy when they furnish preadmission diagnostic
> services to a patient, who is later admitted as an inpatient on the
> same day or within the preceding 3 calendar days (preceding1 calendar
> day), or when they furnish preadmission nondiagnostic services to a
> patient, who is later admitted as an inpatient on the same day or
> within the preceding 3 calendar days (preceding 1 calendar day) for
> related medical care. Only unrelated nondiagnostic preadmission
> services are not subject to the payment window policy, where unrelated
> preadmission nondiagnostic services are clinically distinct or
> independent from the reason for the beneficiary\'s inpatient admission
> and are furnished on the 1^st^, 2^nd^, or 3^rd^ calendar day
> immediately preceding the date of the inpatient admission. (Note:
> nondiagnostic services furnished by a wholly owned or wholly operated
> physician practice on the date of a beneficiary's inpatient admission
> to the hospital are always deemed to be related to the admission and
> their technical portion must be included on the bill for the inpatient
> admission.) When an entity that is wholly owned or wholly operated by
> a hospital furnishes a service subject to the 3-day window policy,
> Medicare will pay the professional component of services with payment
> rates that include a professional and technical split and at the
> facility rate for services that do not have a professional and
> technical split. Once the entity has received confirmation of a
> beneficiary's inpatient admission from the admitting hospital, they
> shall, for services furnished during the three-day window, append a
> CMS payment modifier to all claim lines for diagnostic services and
> for those nondiagnostic services that have been identified as related
> to the inpatient stay. Physician nondiagnostic services that are
> unrelated to the hospital admission are not subject to the payment
> window and shall be billed without the payment modifier.

### Definition of Wholly Owned or Wholly Operated Entities

> Wholly owned or wholly operated entities are defined in 42 CFR §412.2;
> \"An entity is wholly owned by the hospital if the hospital is the
> sole owner of the entity." And, "an entity is wholly operated by a
> hospital if the hospital has exclusive responsibility for conducting
> and overseeing the entity's routine operations, regardless of whether
> the hospital also has policymaking authority over the entity.\"

# - Payment Methodology: 3-Day Payment Window in Wholly Owned or Wholly Operated Entities (including Physician Practices and Clinics)

### (Rev. 2373, Issued: 12-21-11, Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 01-03-12)

> CMS has established HCPCS payment modifier PD (Diagnostic or related
> nondiagnostic item or service provided in a wholly owned or operated
> physician office to a patient who
>
> is admitted as an inpatient within 3 days), and requires that the
> modifier be appended to the physician preadmission diagnostic and
> admission-related nondiagnostic services, reported with HCPCS/CPT
> codes, which are subject to the 3-day payment window policy. The
> wholly owned or wholly operated physician's office will need to manage
> their billing processes to ensure that they bill for their physician
> services appropriately when a related inpatient admission has
> occurred. The hospital is responsible for notifying the practice of an
> inpatient admissions for a patient who received services in a wholly
> owned or wholly operated physician office within the 3-day (or, when
> appropriate,1-day) payment window prior to the inpatient stay. The
> modifier is effective for claims with dates of service on or after
> January 1, 2012. Wholly owned or wholly operated per their readiness
> to do so. Entities have the discretion to apply these policies for
> claims with dates of service on and after January 1, 2012, but shall
> comply with these polices no later than July 1. 2012.
>
> When the modifier is present on claims for service CMS shall pay

-   only the Professional Component (PC) for CPT/HCPCS codes with a
    > Technical Component (TC)/PC split that are provided in the 3-day
    > (or, in the case of non-IPPS hospitals, 1-day) payment window, and

-   The facility rate for codes without a TC/PC split.

### Global Surgical Services and the 3-day Payment Window Policy

> We note that the time frames associated with 10 and 90 day global
> surgical packages could overlap with the 3-day (or 1-day) payment
> window policy. The 3-day payment window makes no change in billing
> surgical services according to global surgical rules, and pre- and
> post-operative services continue to be included in the payment for the
> surgery. However, there may be times when the surgery itself is
> subject to the three-day window policy, as would occur if the surgery
> were performed within the three-day window. For example, a patient
> could have a minor surgery in a wholly owned or wholly operated
> physician office and then, due to a complication, be admitted to the
> hospital as an inpatient. In such cases the modifier shall be appended
> to the appropriate surgical HCPCS/CPT code.

# - Teaching Physician Services

### (Rev. 811, Issued: 01-13-06, Effective: 01-01-06, Implementation: 02-13-06) Definitions

> For purposes of this section, the following definitions apply.
>
> **Resident -** An individual who participates in an approved graduate
> medical education (GME) program or a physician who is not in an
> approved GME program but who is authorized to practice only in a
> hospital setting. The term includes interns and fellows in GME
> programs recognized as approved for purposes of direct GME payments
> made by the FI. Receiving a staff or faculty appointment or
> participating in a fellowship does not
>
> by itself alter the status of \"resident\". Additionally, this status
> remains unaffected regardless of whether a hospital includes the
> physician in its full time equivalency count of residents.
>
> **Student** - An individual who participates in an accredited
> educational program (e.g., a medical school) that is not an approved
> GME program. A student is never considered to be an intern or a
> resident. Medicare does not pay for any service furnished by a
> student. See §100.1.1B for a discussion concerning E/M service
> documentation performed by students.
>
> **Teaching Physician -** A physician (other than another resident) who
> involves residents in the care of his or her patients.
>
> **Direct Medical and Surgical Services -** Services to individual
> beneficiaries that are either personally furnished by a physician or
> furnished by a resident under the supervision of a physician in a
> teaching hospital making the reasonable cost election for physician
> services furnished in teaching hospitals. All payments for such
> services are made by the A/B MAC (A) for the hospital.
>
> **Teaching Hospital -** A hospital engaged in an approved GME
> residency program in medicine, osteopathy, dentistry, or podiatry.
>
> **Teaching Setting -** Any provider, hospital-based provider, or
> nonprovider setting in which Medicare payment for the services of
> residents is made by the A/B MAC (A) under the direct graduate medical
> education payment methodology or freestanding SNF or HHA in which such
> payments are made on a reasonable cost basis.
>
> **Critical or Key Portion** - That part (or parts) of a service that
> the teaching physician determines is (are) a critical or key
> portion(s). For purposes of this section, these terms are
> interchangeable.
>
> **Documentation** - Notes recorded in the patient\'s medical records
> by a resident, and/or teaching physician or others as outlined in the
> specific situations below regarding the service furnished.
> Documentation may be dictated and typed or hand-written, or
> computer-generated and typed or handwritten. Documentation must be
> dated and include a legible signature or identity. Pursuant to 42 CFR
> 415.172 (b), documentation must identify, at a minimum, the service
> furnished, the participation of the teaching physician in providing
> the service, and whether the teaching physician was physically
> present.
>
> In the context of an electronic medical record, the term \'macro\'
> means a command in a computer or dictation application that
> automatically generates predetermined text that is not edited by the
> user.
>
> When using an electronic medical record, it is acceptable for the
> teaching physician to use a macro as the required personal
> documentation if the teaching physician adds it personally in a
> secured (password protected) system. In addition to the teaching
> physician's macro, either the resident or the teaching physician must
> provide customized information that is sufficient to support a medical
> necessity determination. The note in the electronic medical record
> must sufficiently describe the specific services furnished to the
> specific patient on the specific date. It is insufficient
> documentation if both the resident and the teaching physician use
> macros only.
>
> **Physically Present** - The teaching physician is located in the same
> room (or partitioned or curtained area, if the room is subdivided to
> accommodate multiple patients) as the patient and/or performs a
> face-to-face service.

> Evaluation and Management (E/M) Services \-- For a given encounter,
> the selection of the appropriate level of E/M service should be
> determined according to the code definitions in the American Medical
> Association's Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) book and any

### E/M Service Documentation Provided By Students

> Any contribution and participation of students to the performance of a
> billable service (other than the review of systems and/or past
> family/social history which are not separately billable, but are taken
> as part of an E/M service) must be performed in
>
> the physical presence of a teaching physician or physical presence of
> a resident in a service meeting the requirements set forth in this
> section for teaching physician billing.
>
> Students may document services in the medical record. However, the
> teaching physician must verify in the medical record all student
> documentation or findings, including history, physical exam and/or
> medical decision making. The teaching physician must personally
> perform (or re-perform) the physical exam and medical decision making
> activities of the E/M service being billed, but may verify any student
> documentation of them in the medical record, rather than
> re-documenting this work.

### Exception for E/M Services Furnished in Certain Primary Care Centers

> Teaching physicians providing E/M services with a GME program granted
> a primary care exception may bill Medicare for lower and mid-level E/M

>
> Teaching physicians submitting claims under this exception must:

-   Not have other responsibilities (including the supervision of other
    > personnel) at the time the service was provided by the residents;

-   Have the primary medical responsibility for patients cared for by
    > the residents;

-   Ensure that the care provided was reasonable and necessary;

-   Review the care provided by the residents during or immediately
    > after each visit. This must include a review of the patient's
    > medical history, the resident's findings on physical examination,
    > the patient's diagnosis, and treatment plan (i.e., record of tests
    > and therapies); and

> Patients under this exception should consider the center to be their

# - Surgical Procedures

### (Rev. 2303, Issued: 09-14-11, Effective: 06-01-11, Implementation: 07-26-11)

> In order to bill for surgical, high-risk, or other complex procedures,
> the teaching physician must be present during all critical and key
> portions of the procedure and be immediately available to furnish
> services during the entire procedure.

### A. Surgery (Including Endoscopic Operations)

> The teaching surgeon is responsible for the preoperative, operative,
> and postoperative care of the beneficiary. The teaching physician's
> presence is not required during the opening and closing of the
> surgical field unless these activities are considered to be critical
> or key portions of the procedure. The teaching surgeon determines
> which postoperative visits are considered key or critical and require
> his or her presence. If the postoperative period extends beyond the
> patient's discharge and the teaching surgeon is not providing the
> patient's follow-up care, then instructions on billing for less than
> the global package in §40 apply. During non-critical or non-key
> portions of the surgery, if the teaching surgeon is not physically
> present, he/she must be immediately available to return to the
> procedure, i.e., he/she cannot be performing another procedure. If
> circumstances prevent a teaching physician from being immediately
> available, then he/she must arrange for another qualified surgeon to
> be immediately available to assist with the procedure, if needed.

### Single Surgery

> When the teaching surgeon is present for the entire surgery, his or
> her presence may be demonstrated by notes in the medical records made
> by the physician, resident, or operating room nurse. For purposes of
> this teaching physician policy, there is no required information that
> the teaching surgeon must enter into the medical records.

### Two Overlapping Surgeries

> In order to bill Medicare for two overlapping surgeries, the teaching
> surgeon must be present during the critical or key portions of both
> operations. Therefore, the critical or key portions may not take place
> at the same time. When all of the key portions of the initial
> procedure have been completed, the teaching surgeon may begin to
> become involved in a second procedure. The teaching surgeon must
> personally document in the medical record that he/she was physically
> present during the critical or key portion(s) of both procedures. When
> a teaching physician is not present during non-critical or non-key
> portions of the procedure and is participating in another surgical
> procedure, he/she must arrange for another qualified surgeon to
> immediately assist the resident in the other case should the need
> arise. In the case of three concurrent surgical procedures, the role
> of the teaching surgeon (but not anesthesiologist) in each of the
> cases is classified as a supervisory service to the hospital rather
> than a physician service to an individual patient and is not payable
> under the physician fee schedule.

### Minor Procedures

> For procedures that take only a few minutes (five minutes or less) to
> complete, e.g., simple suture, and involve relatively little decision
> making once the need for the operation is determined, the teaching
> surgeon must be present for the entire procedure in order to bill for
> the procedure.

### Anesthesia

> Medicare pays at the regular fee schedule level if a teaching
> anesthesiologist is involved in a single procedure with one resident.
> The teaching physician must document in the medical records that
> he/she was present during all critical (or key) portions of the
> procedure. The teaching physician's physical presence during
> [only]{.underline} the preoperative or postoperative visits with the
> beneficiary is not sufficient to receive Medicare payment. If an
> anesthesiologist is involved in concurrent procedures with more than
> one resident or with a resident and a nonphysician anesthetist and the
> service is furnished prior to January 1, 2010, Medicare pays for the
> anesthesiologist's services as medical direction.
>
> In those cases where the teaching anesthesiologist is involved in two
> concurrent anesthesia cases with residents on or after January 1,
> 2004, the teaching anesthesiologist may bill the usual base units and
> anesthesia time for the amount of time he/she is present with the
> resident. The teaching anesthesiologist can bill base units if he/she
> is present with the resident throughout pre and post anesthesia care.
> The teaching anesthesiologist should use the "AA" modifier to report
> such cases. The teaching anesthesiologist must document his/her
> involvement in cases with residents. The documentation must be
> sufficient to support the payment of the fee and available for review
> upon request.
>
> For anesthesia services furnished on or after January 1, 2010, payment
> may be made under the Medicare physician fee schedule at the regular
> fee schedule level if the teaching anesthesiologist is involved in the
> training of a resident in a single anesthesia case, two concurrent
> anesthesia cases involving residents, or a single anesthesia case
> involving a resident that is concurrent to another case paid under the
> medical direction rules. To
>
> qualify for payment, the teaching anesthesiologist, or different
> anesthesiologists in the same anesthesia group, must be present during
> all critical or key portions of the anesthesia service or procedure
> involved. The teaching anesthesiologist (or another anesthesiologist
> with whom the teaching physician has entered into an arrangement) must
> be immediately available to furnish anesthesia services during the
> entire procedure. The documentation in the patient's medical records
> must indicate the teaching physician's presence during all critical or
> key portions of the anesthesia procedure and the immediate
> availability of another teaching anesthesiologist as necessary.
>
> If different teaching anesthesiologists are present with the resident
> during the key or critical periods of the resident case, the NPI of
> the teaching anesthesiologist who started the case must be indicated
> in the appropriate field on the claim form.
>
> The teaching anesthesiologist should use the "AA" modifier and the
> "GC" certification modifier to report such cases. See §50 B. and §0 K.

### Endoscopy Procedures

> To bill Medicare for endoscopic procedures (excluding endoscopic
> surgery that follows the surgery policy in subsection A, above), the
> teaching physician must be present during the entire viewing. The
> entire viewing starts at the time of insertion of the endoscope and
> ends at the time of removal of the endoscope. Viewing of the entire
> procedure through a monitor in another room does not meet the teaching
> physician presence requirement.

### Interpretation of Diagnostic Radiology and Other Diagnostic Tests

> Medicare pays for the interpretation of diagnostic radiology and other
> diagnostic tests if the interpretation is performed by or reviewed
> with a teaching physician. If the teaching physician's signature is
> the only signature on the interpretation, Medicare assumes that he/she
> is indicating that he/she personally performed the interpretation. If
> a resident prepares and signs the interpretation, the teaching
> physician must indicate that he/she has personally reviewed the image
> and the resident's interpretation and either agrees with it or edits
> the findings. Medicare does not pay for an interpretation if the
> teaching physician only countersigns the resident's interpretation.

# - Psychiatry

### (Rev. 811, Issued: 01-13-06, Effective: 01-01-06, Implementation: 02-13-06)

> The general teaching physician policy set forth in §100.1 applies to
> psychiatric services. For certain psychiatric services, the
> requirement for the presence of the teaching physician during the
> service may be met by concurrent observation of the service by use of
> a one-way mirror or video equipment. Audio-only equipment does not
> satisfy to the physical presence requirement. In the case of
> time-based services such as individual medical psychotherapy, see
> [§100.1.4]{.underline}, below. Further, the teaching physician
> supervising the resident must be a physician, i.e., the Medicare
> teaching physician policy does not apply to psychologists who
> supervise psychiatry residents in approved GME programs.

# - Time-Based Codes

### (Rev. 11288; Issued: 03-04-22; Effective: 01-01-22; Implementation: 02-15-22)

> For procedure codes determined on the basis of time, the teaching
> physician must be present for the period of time for which the claim
> is made. For example, a code that specifically describes a service of
> from 20 to 30 minutes may be paid only if the teaching physician is
> physically present for 20 to 30 minutes. Do not add time spent by the
> resident in the absence of the teaching physician to time spent by the
> resident and teaching physician with the beneficiary or time spent by
> the teaching physician alone with the beneficiary. Examples of codes
> falling into this category include:

-   Individual medical psychotherapy (HCPCS codes 90804 - 90829);

-   Critical care services (CPT codes 99291-99292);

-   Hospital discharge day management (CPT codes 99238-99239);

> E/M codes in which counseling and/or coordination of care dominates
> (more than 50 percent) of the encounter, and time is considered the
> key or controlling factor to qualify for a particular level of E/M
> service;

-   Office/outpatient E/M visit codes for which total time is used for
    > the visit level selection. For purposes of selecting visit level,
    > only count time spent by the teaching physician performing
    > qualifying activities listed by CPT (with or without direct
    > patient contact on the date of the encounter), including the time
    > the teaching physician is present when the resident is performing
    > such activities;

-   Prolonged services (CPT codes 99358-99359); and

-   Care plan oversight (HCPCS codes G0181 - G0182).

    1.  # - Other Complex or High-Risk Procedures

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> In the case of complex or high-risk procedures for which national
> Medicare policy, local policy, or the CPT description indicate that
> the procedure requires personal (in person) supervision of its
> performance by a physician, pay for the physician services associated
> with the procedure only when the teaching physician is present with
> the resident. The presence of the resident alone would not establish a
> basis for fee schedule payment for such services. These procedures
> include interventional radiologic and cardiologic supervision and
> interpretation codes, cardiac catheterization, cardiovascular stress
> tests, and trans-esophageal echocardiography.

# - Miscellaneous

### (Rev. 1458, Issued: 02-22-08, Effective: 03-24-08, Implementation: 03-24-08)

> In the case of maternity services furnished to women who are eligible
> for Medicare, apply the physician presence requirement for both types
> of delivery as A/B MACs (B) would for surgery. In order to bill for
> the procedure, the teaching physician must be present for the
> delivery. These procedure codes are somewhat different from other
> surgery codes in that there are separate codes for global obstetrical
> care (prepartum, delivery, and postpartum) and for deliveries only. In
> situations in which the teaching physician's only involvement was at
> the time of delivery, the teaching physician should bill the delivery
> only code. In order to bill for the global procedures, the teaching
> physician must be present for the minimum indicated number of visits
> when such a number is specified in the description of the code. This
> policy differs from the policy on general surgical procedures under
> which the teaching physician is not required to be present for a
> specified number of visits.
>
> In the case of end stage renal related visits furnished under the
> monthly capitation payment method (MCP), the physician presence policy
> as discussed in §100.1 applies. Patient visits furnished by residents
> may be counted toward the MCP visits if the teaching MCP physician is
> physically present during the visit. The teaching physician may
> utilize the resident's notes, however the teaching physician must
> document his or her physical presence during the visit(s) furnished by
> the resident and that he or she reviewed the resident's notes. The
> teaching physician could document these criteria as part of an
> extensive once a month MCP note.

# - Assistants at Surgery in Teaching Hospitals

### (Rev. 811, Issued: 01-13-06, Effective: 01-01-06, Implementation: 02-13-06)

A.  **General**

> A/B MACs (B) do not pay for the services of assistants at surgery
> furnished in a teaching hospital which has a training program related
> to the medical specialty required for the surgical procedure and has a
> qualified resident available to perform the service unless the
> requirements of one of subsections C, D, or E are met. Each teaching
> hospital has a different situation concerning numbers of residents,
> qualifications of residents, duties of residents, and types of
> surgeries performed.
>
> Contact those affected by these instructions to learn the
> circumstances in individual teaching hospitals. There may be some
> teaching hospitals in which A/B MACs (B) can apply a presumption about
> the availability of a qualified resident in a training program related
> to the medical specialty required for the surgical procedures, but
> there are other teaching hospitals in which there are often no
> qualified residents available. This may be due to their involvement in
> other activities, complexity of the surgery, numbers of residents in
> the program, or other valid reasons. A/B MACs (B) process assistant at
> surgery claims for services furnished in teaching hospitals on the
> basis of the following certification by the assistant, or through the
> use of modifier -82 which indicates that a qualified resident surgeon
> was not available. This certification is for use only when the basis
> for payment is the unavailability of qualified residents.
>
> I understand that
> [[§1842(b)(7)(D)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm)
> of the Act (follow the link and select the applicable title) generally
> prohibits Medicare physician fee schedule payment for the services of
> assistants at surgery in teaching hospitals when qualified residents
> are available to furnish such services. I certify that the services
> for which payment is claimed were medically necessary and that no
> qualified resident was available to perform the services. I further
> understand that these services are subject to post-payment review by
> the A/B MAC (B).
>
> A/B MACs (B) retain the claim and certification for four years and
> conduct post-payment reviews as necessary. For example, A/B MACs (B)
> investigate situations in which it is always certified that there are
> no qualified residents available, and undertake recovery if warranted.
>
> Assistant at surgery claims denied based on these instructions do not
> qualify for payment under the limitation on liability provision.

### Definition

> An assistant at surgery is a physician who actively assists the
> physician in charge of a case in performing a surgical procedure.
> (Note that a nurse practitioner, physician assistant or clinical nurse
> specialist who is authorized to provide such services under State law
> can also serve as an assistant at surgery). The conditions for
> coverage of such services in teaching hospitals are more restrictive
> than those in other settings because of the availability of residents
> who are qualified to perform this type of service.

### Exceptional Circumstances

> Payment may be made for the services of assistants at surgery in
> teaching hospitals, subject to the special limitation in §20.4.3
> notwithstanding the availability of a qualified resident to furnish
> the services. There may be exceptional medical circumstances (e.g.,
> emergency, life-threatening situations such as multiple traumatic
> injuries) which require immediate treatment. There may be other
> situations in which the medical staff may find that exceptional
> medical circumstances justify the services of a physician assistant at
> surgery even though a qualified resident is available.

### Physicians Who Do Not Involve Residents in Patient Care

> Payment may be made for the services of assistants at surgery in
> teaching hospitals, subject to the limitations in §20.4.3, above, if
> the primary surgeon has an across-the- board policy of never involving
> residents in the preoperative, operative, or postoperative care of his
> or her patients. Generally, this exception is applied to community
> physicians who have no involvement in the hospital's GME program. In
> such situations, payment may be made for reasonable and necessary
> services on the same basis as would be the case in a nonteaching
> hospital. However, if the assistant is not a physician primarily
> engaged in the field of surgery, no payment be made unless either of
> the criteria of subsection E is met.

### Multiple Physician Specialties Involved in Surgery

> Complex medical procedures, including multistage transplant surgery
> and coronary bypass, may require a team of physicians. In these
> situations, each of the physicians performs a unique, discrete
> function requiring special skills integral to the total procedure.
> Each physician is engaged in a level of activity different from
> assisting the surgeon in charge of the case. The special payment
> limitation in §20.4.3 is not applied. If payment is made on the basis
> of a single team fee, additional claims are denied. The A/B MAC (B)
> will determine which procedures performed in the service area require
> a team approach to surgery. Team surgery is paid for on a "By Report"
> basis.
>
> The services of physicians of different specialties may be necessary
> during surgery when each specialist is required to play an active role
> in the patient's treatment because of the existence of more than one
> medical condition requiring diverse, specialized medical services. For
> example, a patient's cardiac condition may require a cardiologist be
> present to monitor the patient's condition during abdominal surgery.
> In this type of situation, the physician furnishing the concurrent
> care is functioning at a different level than that of an assistant at
> surgery, and payment is made on a regular fee schedule basis.

# - Physician Billing in the Teaching Setting

### (Rev. 2303, Issued: 09-14-11, Effective: 06-01-11, Implementation: 07-26-11)

A.  **A/B MAC (B) Claims**

> The method by which services performed in a teaching setting must be
> billed is determined by the manner in which reimbursement is made for
> such services. For A/B MACs (B), the shared system suspends claims
> submitted by a teaching physician, for review.

### Billing Modifiers

> Effective January 1, 1997, services furnished by teaching physicians
> involving a resident in the care of their patients must be identified
> as such on the claim. To be payable, claims for services furnished by
> teaching physicians involving a resident must comply with the
> requirements in sections 100.1 through 100.1.6 of this chapter, as
> applicable.
>
> Claims for services meeting these requirements must show either the GC
> or GE modifier as appropriate and described below.

### Teaching Physician Services that Meet the Requirement for Presence During the Key/Critical Portion of the Service

> Claims for teaching physician services in compliance with the
> requirements outlined in sections 100.1 -100.1.6 of this chapter must
> include a GC modifier for each service, unless the service is
> furnished under the primary care center exception described in section
> 100.1.1C (refer to number 2, below). When a physician (or other
> appropriate
>
> billing provider) places the GC modifier on the claim, he/she is
> certifying that the teaching physician has complied with the
> requirements in sections 100.1 through 100.1.6.

### Teaching Physician Services Under the Exception for E/M Services Furnished in Primary Care Centers

> Teaching physicians who meet the requirements in section 100.1.1C of
> this chapter must provide their A/B MAC (B) with an attestation that
> they meet the requirements. Claims for services furnished by teaching
> physicians under the primary care center exception must include the GE

# - Payment for Anesthesia Services Furnished by a Teaching CRNA

### (Rev. 3747; Issued: 04-14-17; Effective: 01-01-17; Implementation: 05-15-17)

> Payment can be made under Part B to a teaching CRNA who supervises a

>
> The A/B MAC may allow payment, as follows, if a teaching CRNA is
> involved in cases with two student nurse anesthetists:

-   Recognize the full base units (assigned to the anesthesia code)
    > where the teaching CRNA is present with the student nurse
    > anesthetist throughout pre and post anesthesia care; and

-   Recognize the actual time the teaching CRNA is personally present
    > with the student nurse anesthetist. Anesthesia time may be
    > discontinuous. For example, a teaching CRNA is involved in two
    > concurrent cases with student nurse anesthetists. Case 1 runs from
    > 9:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. and case 2 runs from 9:45a.m. to 11:30
    > a.m. The teaching CRNA is present in case 1 from 9:00 a.m. to 9:30
    > a.m. and from 10:15 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. From 9:45 a.m. to 10:14
    > a.m. and from 10:31 a.m. to 11:30 a.m., the CRNA is present in
    > case 2. The CRNA may report 45 minutes of anesthesia time for case
    > 1 (i.e., 3 time units) and 88 minutes (i.e., 5.9 units) of
    > anesthesia time for case 2.

> The teaching CRNA must document his/her involvement in cases with
> student nurse anesthetists. The documentation must be sufficient to
> support the payment of the fee and available for review upon request.
>
> The teaching CRNA (not under the medical direction of a physician),
> can be paid for his or her involvement in each of two concurrent cases
> with student nurse anesthetists; allow payment at the regular fee
> schedule rate. The teaching CRNA reports the anesthesia service using
> the QZmodifier.
>
> To bill the anesthesia base units, the teaching CRNA must be present
> with the student nurse anesthetist during pre and post anesthesia care
> for each of the two cases. To bill anesthesia time for each case, the
> teaching CRNA must continue to devote his or her time to the two
> concurrent cases and not be involved in other activities. The teaching
> CRNA can decide how to allocate his or her time to optimize patient
> care in the two cases based on the complexity of the anesthesia cases,
> the experience and skills of the student nurse anesthetists, and the

### (Rev. 999, Issued: 07-14-06; Effective: 01-01-05; Implementation: 10-02-06)

> The Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15, contains requirements
> for coverage for medical and other health services including those of
> physicians and non-physician practitioners.
>
> Care plan oversight (CPO) is the physician supervision of a patient
> receiving complex and/or multidisciplinary care as part of
> Medicare-covered services provided by a participating home health
> agency or Medicare approved hospice.
>
> CPO services require complex or multidisciplinary care modalities
> involving:

-   Regular physician development and/or revision of care plans;

-   Review of subsequent reports of patient status;

-   Review of related laboratory and other studies;

-   Communication with other health professionals not employed in the
    > same practice who are involved in the patient's care;

-   Integration of new information into the medical treatment plan;
    > and/or

-   Adjustment of medical therapy.

> The CPO services require recurrent physician supervision of a patient
> involving 30 or more minutes of the physician's time per month.
> Services not countable toward the 30 minutes threshold that must be
> provided in order to bill for CPO include, but are not limited to:

-   Time associated with discussions with the patient, his or her family
    > or friends to adjust medication or treatment;

-   Time spent by staff getting or filing charts;

-   Travel time; and/or

-   Physician's time spent telephoning prescriptions into the pharmacist
    > unless the telephone conversation involves discussions of
    > pharmaceutical therapies.

> Implicit in the concept of CPO is the expectation that the physician
> has coordinated an aspect of the patient's care with the home health
> agency or hospice during the month for which CPO services were billed.
> The physician who bills for CPO must be the same physician who signs
> the plan of care.
>
> Nurse practitioners, physician assistants, and clinical nurse
> specialists, practicing within the scope of State law, may bill for
> care plan oversight. These non-physician practitioners must have been
> providing ongoing care for the beneficiary through evaluation and
> management services. These non-physician practitioners may not bill
> for CPO if they have been involved only with the delivery of the
> Medicare-covered home health or hospice service.

### Home Health CPO

> Non-physician practitioners can perform CPO only if the physician
> signing the plan of care provides regular ongoing care under the same
> plan of care as does the NPP billing for CPO and either:

-   The physician and NPP are part of the same group practice; or

-   If the NPP is a nurse practitioner or clinical nurse specialist, the
    > physician signing the plan of care also has a collaborative
    > agreement with the NPP; or

-   If the NPP is a physician assistant, the physician signing the plan
    > of care is also the physician who provides general supervision of
    > physician assistant services for the practice.

> Billing may be made for care plan oversight services furnished by an
> NPP when:

-   The NPP providing the care plan oversight has seen and examined the
    > patient;

-   The NPP providing care plan oversight is not functioning as a
    > consultant whose participation is limited to a single medical
    > condition rather than multidisciplinary coordination of care; and

-   The NPP providing care plan oversight integrates his or her care
    > with that of the physician who signed the plan of care.

> NPPs may not certify the beneficiary for home health care.

### Hospice CPO

> The attending physician or nurse practitioner (who has been designated
> as the attending physician) may bill for hospice CPO when they are
> acting as an "attending physician". An "attending physician" is one
> who has been identified by the individual, at the time he/she elects
> hospice coverage, as having the most significant role in the
> determination and delivery of their medical care. They are not
> employed nor paid by the hospice. The care plan oversight services are
> billed using Form CMS-1500 or electronic equivalent.
>
> For additional information on hospice CPO, see Chapter 11, §40.1.3.1
> of this manual.

A.  **Codes for Which Separate Payment May Be Made**

> Effective January 1, 1995, separate payment may be made for CPO
> oversight services for 30 minutes or more if the requirements
> specified in the Medicare Benefits Policy Manual, Chapter 15 are met.
>
> Providers billing for CPO must submit the claim with no other services
> billed on that claim and may bill only after the end of the month in
> which the CPO services were rendered. CPO services may not be billed
> across calendar months and should be submitted (and paid) only for one
> unit of service.
>
> Physicians may bill and be paid separately for CPO services only if
> all the criteria in the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Chapter 15 are
> met.

### Physician Certification and Recertification of Home Health Plans of Care

> Effective 2001, two new HCPCS codes for the certification and
> recertification and development of plans of care for Medicare-covered
> home health services were created. See the Medicare General
> Information, Eligibility, and Entitlement Manual, Pub. 100-01, Chapter
> 4, "Physician Certification and Recertification of Services," §10-60,
> and the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, Pub. 100-02, Chapter 7, "Home
> Health Services", §30.
>
> The home health agency certification code can be billed only when the
> patient has not received Medicare-covered home health services for at
> least 60 days. The home health agency recertification code is used
> after a patient has received services for at least 60 days (or one
> certification period) when the physician signs the certification after
> the initial certification period. The home health agency
> recertification code will be reported only once every 60 days, except
> in the rare situation when the patient starts a new episode before 60
> days elapses and requires a new plan of care to start a new episode.

### Provider Number of Home Health Agency (HHA) or Hospice

> For claims for CPO submitted on or after January 1, 1997, physicians
> must enter on the Medicare claim form the 6-character Medicare
> provider number of the HHA or hospice providing Medicare-covered
> services to the beneficiary for the period during which CPO services
> was furnished and for which the physician signed the plan of care.
> Physicians are responsible for obtaining the HHA or hospice Medicare
> provider numbers.
>
> Additionally, physicians should provide their UPIN to the HHA or
> hospice furnishing services to their patient.
>
> **NOTE:** There is currently no place on the HIPAA standard ASC X12N
> 837 professional format to specifically include the HHA or hospice
> provider number required for a care plan oversight claim. For this
> reason, the requirement to include the HHA or hospice provider number
> on a care plan oversight claim is temporarily waived until a new

### (Rev. 1635, Issued: 11-14-08, Effective: 01-01-09, Implementation: 01-05-09)

> Section 223 of the Medicare, Medicaid and SCHIP Benefits Improvement
> and Protection Act of 2000 (BIPA) - Revision of Medicare Reimbursement
> for Telehealth Services amended
> [[§1834]{.underline}](thttp://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm)
> (go to the link and then select the applicable title) of the Act to
> provide for an expansion of Medicare payment for telehealth services.
>
> Effective October 1, 2001, coverage and payment for Medicare
> telehealth includes consultation, office visits, individual
> psychotherapy, and pharmacologic management
>
> delivered via a telecommunications system. Eligible geographic areas
> include rural health professional shortage areas (HPSA) and counties
> not classified as a metropolitan statistical area (MSA). Additionally,
> Federal telemedicine demonstration projects as of December 31, 2000,
> may serve as the originating site regardless of geographic location.
>
> An interactive telecommunications system is required as a condition of
> payment; however, BIPA does allow the use of asynchronous "store and
> forward" technology in delivering these services when the originating
> site is a Federal telemedicine demonstration program in Alaska or
> Hawaii. BIPA does not require that a practitioner present the patient
> for interactive telehealth services.
>
> With regard to payment amount, BIPA specified that payment for the
> professional service performed by the distant site practitioner (i.e.,
> where the expert physician or practitioner is physically located at
> time of telemedicine encounter) is equal to what would have been paid
> without the use of telemedicine. Distant site practitioners include
> only a physician as described in
> [[§1861(r)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm)
> (go to the link and select the applicable title) of the Act and a

> [[§1842(b)(18)(C)]{.underline}](http://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/ssact/title18/1800.htm)
> (go to the link and select the applicable title) of the Act. BIPA also
> expanded payment under Medicare to include a
>
> \$20 originating site facility fee (location of beneficiary).
>
> Previously, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 (BBA) limited the scope of
> Medicare telehealth coverage to consultation services and the
> implementing regulation prohibited the use of an asynchronous, 'store
> and forward' telecommunications system. BBA 1997 also required the
> professional fee to be shared between the referring and consulting
> practitioners, and prohibited Medicare payment for facility fees and
> line charges associated with the telemedicine encounter.
>
> BIPA required that Medicare Part B (Supplementary Medical Insurance)
> pay for this expansion of telehealth services beginning with services
> furnished on October 1, 2001.
>
> Section 149 of the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers
> Act of 2008 (MIPPA) amended §1834 of the Act to add certain entities
> as originating sites for payment of telehealth services. Effective for
> services furnished on or after January 1, 2009, eligible originating
> sites include a hospital-based or critical access hospital-based renal
> dialysis center (including satellites); a skilled nursing facility (as
> defined in
>
> §1819(a) of the Act); and a community mental health center (as defined
> in
>
> §1861(ff)(3)(B) of the Act). MIPPA also amended§1888(e)(2)(A)(ii) of
> the Act to exclude telehealth services furnished under
> §1834(m)(4)(C)(ii)(VII) from the consolidated billing provisions of
> the skilled nursing facility prospective payment system (SNF PPS).
>
> **NOTE:** MIPPA did not add independent renal dialysis facilities as
> originating sites for payment of telehealth services.

# - List of Medicare Telehealth Services

### (Rev. 3476, Issued: 03-11-16, Effective: 01-01-15, Effective: 04-11-16)

> The use of a telecommunications system may substitute for an in-person
> encounter for professional consultations, office visits, office
> psychiatry services, and a limited number of other physician fee
> schedule (PFS) services. The various services and corresponding
> current procedure terminology (CPT) or Healthcare Common Procedure
> Coding System (HCPCS) codes are listed on the CMS website at

>
> **NOTE:** Beginning January 1, 2010, CMS eliminated the use of all
> consultation codes, except for inpatient telehealth consultation
> G-codes. CMS no longer recognizes office/outpatient or inpatient
> consultation CPT codes for payment of office/outpatient or inpatient
> visits. Instead, physicians and practitioners are instructed to bill a
> new or established patient office/outpatient visit CPT code or
> appropriate hospital or nursing facility care code, as appropriate to
> the particular patient, for all office/outpatient or inpatient visits.

# - Telehealth Consultation Services, Emergency Department or Initial Inpatient versus Inpatient Evaluation and Management (E/M)

> **Visits**

### (Rev. 2354, Issued: 11-18-11 Effective: 01-01-12, Implementation: 01-03-12)

> A consultation service is an evaluation and management (E/M) service
> furnished to evaluate and possibly treat a patient's problem(s). It
> can involve an opinion, advice, recommendation, suggestion, direction,
> or counsel from a physician or qualified nonphysician practitioner
> (NPP) at the request of another physician or appropriate source.
>
> Section 1834(m) of the Social Security Act includes "professional
> consultations" in the definition of telehealth services. Inpatient or
> emergency department consultations furnished via telehealth can
> facilitate the provision of certain services and/or medical expertise
> that might not otherwise be available to a patient located at an
> originating site.
>
> The use of a telecommunications system may substitute for an in-person
> encounter for emergency department or initial and follow-up inpatient
> consultations.
>
> Medicare A/B MACs (B) pay for reasonable and medically necessary
> inpatient or emergency department telehealth consultation services
> furnished to beneficiaries in hospitals or SNFs when all of the
> following criteria for the use of a consultation code are met:

-   An inpatient or emergency department consultation service is
    > distinguished from other inpatient or emergency department
    > evaluation and management (E/M) visits because it is provided by a
    > physician or qualified nonphysician practitioner (NPP) whose
    > opinion or advice regarding evaluation and/or management of a
    > specific problem is requested by another physician or other
    > appropriate source. The qualified NPP may perform consultation
    > services within the scope of practice and licensure requirements
    > for NPPs in the State in which he/she practices;

-   A request for an inpatient or emergency department telehealth
    > consultation from an appropriate source and the need for an
    > inpatient or emergency department telehealth consultation (i.e.,
    > the reason for a consultation service) shall be documented by the
    > consultant in the patient's medical record and included in the
    > requesting physician or qualified NPP's plan of care in the
    > patient's medical record; and

-   After the inpatient or emergency department telehealth consultation
    > is provided, the consultant shall prepare a written report of
    > his/her findings and recommendations, which shall be provided to
    > the referring physician.

> The intent of an inpatient or emergency department telehealth
> consultation service is that a physician or qualified NPP or other
> appropriate source is asking another physician or qualified NPP for
> advice, opinion, a recommendation, suggestion, direction, or counsel,
> etc. in evaluating or treating a patient because that individual has
> expertise in a specific medical area beyond the requesting
> professional's knowledge.
>
> Unlike inpatient or emergency department telehealth consultations, the
> majority of subsequent inpatient hospital, emergency department and
> nursing facility care services require in-person visits to facilitate
> the comprehensive, coordinated, and personal care that medically
> volatile, acutely ill patients require on an ongoing basis.
>
> Subsequent hospital care services are limited to one telehealth visit
> every 3 days. Subsequent nursing facility care services are limited to
> one telehealth visit every 30 days.

# -- Payment for ESRD-Related Services as a Telehealth Service

### (Rev. 3476, Issued: 03-11-16, Effective: 01-01-15, Effective: 04-11-16)

> The ESRD-related services included in the monthly capitation payment
> (MCP) with 2 or 3 visits per month and ESRD-related services with 4 or
> more visits per month may be paid as Medicare telehealth services.
> However, at least 1 visit must be furnished face-to-
>
> face "hands on" to examine the vascular access site by a physician,
> clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, or physician assistant.
> An interactive audio and video telecommunications system may be used
> for providing additional visits required under the 2-to-3 visit MCP
> and the 4-or-more visit MCP. The medical record must indicate that at
> least one of the visits was furnished face-to-face "hands on" by a
> physician, clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner, or physician
> assistant.
>
> The MCP physician, for example, the physician or practitioner who is
> responsible for the complete monthly assessment of the patient and
> establishes the patient's plan of care, may use other physicians and
> practitioners to furnish ESRD-related visits through an interactive
> audio and video telecommunications system. The non-MCP physician or
> practitioner must have a relationship with the billing physician or
> practitioner such as a partner, employees of the same group practice
> or an employee of the MCP physician, for example, the non MCP
> physician or practitioner is either a W-2 employee or 1099 independent
> contractor. However, the physician or practitioner who is responsible
> for the complete monthly assessment and establishes the ESRD
> beneficiary's plan of care should bill for the MCP in any given month.

### Clinical Criteria

> The visit, including a clinical examination of the vascular access
> site, must be conducted face-to-face "hands on" by a physician,
> clinical nurse specialist, nurse practitioner or physician's
> assistant. For additional visits, the physician or practitioner at the
> distant site is required, at a minimum, to use an interactive audio
> and video telecommunications system that allows the physician or
> practitioner to provide medical management services for a maintenance
> dialysis beneficiary. For example, an ESRD-related visit conducted via
> telecommunications system must permit the physician or practitioner at
> the distant site to perform an assessment of whether the dialysis is
> working effectively and whether the patient is tolerating the
> procedure well (physiologically and psychologically). During this
> assessment, the physician or practitioner at the distant site must be
> able to determine whether alteration in any aspect of the
> beneficiary's prescription is indicated, due to such changes as the
> estimate of the patient's dry weight.

    code 02 or Critical Access Hospitals, CAH method II (revenue codes
    096X, 097X, or 098X); or

-   Telehealth originating site facility fee, billed with HCPCS code
    Q3014.

# - Conditions of Payment

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

1.  **Technology**

> For Medicare payment to occur, interactive audio and video
> telecommunications must be used, permitting real-time communication
> between the distant site physician or practitioner and the Medicare
> beneficiary. As a condition of payment, the patient must be present
> and participating in the telehealth visit.

### Exception to the interactive telecommunications requirement

> In the case of Federal telemedicine demonstration programs conducted
> in Alaska or Hawaii, Medicare payment is permitted for telemedicine
> when asynchronous "store and forward technology" in single or
> multimedia formats is used as a substitute for an interactive
> telecommunications system. The originating site and distant site
> practitioner must be included within the definition of the
> demonstration program.

### "Store and forward" defined

> For purposes of this instruction, "store and forward" means the
> asynchronous transmission of medical information to be reviewed at a
> later time by physician or practitioner at the distant site. A
> patient's medical information may include, but not limited to, video
> clips, still images, x-rays, MRIs, EKGs and EEGs, laboratory results,
> audio clips, and text. The physician or practitioner at the distant
> site reviews the case without the patient being present. Store and
> forward substitutes for an interactive encounter with the patient
> present; the patient is not present in real-time.
>
> **NOTE:** Asynchronous telecommunications system in single media
> format does not include telephone calls, images transmitted via
> facsimile machines and text messages without visualization of the
> patient (electronic mail). Photographs must be specific to the
> patients' condition and adequate for rendering or confirming a
> diagnosis and or treatment plan. Dermatological photographs, e.g., a
> photograph of a skin lesion, may be considered to meet the requirement
> of a single media format under this instruction.

### Telepresenters

> A medical professional is not required to present the beneficiary to
> physician or practitioner at the distant site unless medically
> necessary. The decision of medical necessity will be made by the
> physician or practitioner located at the distant site.

# - Originating Site Facility Fee Payment Methodology

### (Rev. 3476, Issued: 03-11-16, Effective: 01-01-15, Effective: 04-11-16)

1.  **Originating site defined**

> The term originating site means the location of an eligible Medicare
> beneficiary at the time the service being furnished via a
> telecommunications system occurs. For asynchronous, store and forward
> telecommunications technologies, an originating site is only a Federal
> telemedicine demonstration program conducted in Alaska or Hawaii.

### Facility fee for originating site

> The originating site facility fee is a separately billable Part B
> payment. The contractor pays it outside of other payment
> methodologies. This fee is subject to post payment verification.
>
> For telehealth services furnished from October 1, 2001, through
> December 31, 2002, the originating site facility fee was the lesser of
> \$20 or the actual charge. For services furnished on or after January
> 1 of each subsequent year, the originating site facility fee is
> updated by the Medicare Economic Index. The updated fee is included in
> the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (MPFS) Final Rule, which is
> published by November 1 prior to the start of the calendar year for
> which it is effective. The updated fee for each calendar year is also
> issued annually in a Recurring Update Notification instruction for
> January of each year.

### Payment amount:

> The originating site facility fee is a separately billable Part B
> payment. The payment amount to the originating site is the lesser of
> 80 percent of the actual charge or 80 percent of the originating site
> facility fee, except CAHs. The beneficiary is responsible for any
> unmet deductible amount and Medicare coinsurance.
>
> The originating site facility fee payment methodology for each type of
> facility is clarified below.
>
> Hospital outpatient department. When the originating site is a

# - Payment Methodology for Physician/Practitioner at the Distant Site

### (Rev. 3586, Issued: 08-12-16, Effective: 01-01-17, Implementation: 01-03-17)

1.  **Distant Site Defined**

> The term "distant site" means the site where the physician or
> practitioner, providing the professional service, is located at the
> time the service is provided via a telecommunications system.

### Payment Amount (professional fee)

> The payment amount for the professional service provided via a
> telecommunications system by the physician or practitioner at the
> distant site is equal to the current fee schedule amount for the
> service provided at the facility rate. Payment for an office visit,
> consultation, individual psychotherapy or pharmacologic management via
> a telecommunications system should be made at the same facility amount
> as when these services are furnished without the use of a
> telecommunications system. For Medicare payment to occur, the service
> must be within a practitioner's scope of practice under State law. The
> beneficiary is responsible for any unmet deductible amount and
> applicable coinsurance.

### Medicare Practitioners Who May Receive Payment at the Distant Site (i.e., at a site other than where beneficiary is)

> As a condition of Medicare Part B payment for telehealth services, the
> physician or practitioner at the distant site must be licensed to
> provide the service under state law. When the physician or
> practitioner at the distant site is licensed under state law to
> provide a covered telehealth service (i.e., professional consultation,
> office and other outpatient visits, individual psychotherapy, and
> pharmacologic management) then he or she may bill for and receive
> payment for this service when delivered via a telecommunications
> system.
>
> If the physician or practitioner at the distant site is located in a
> CAH that has elected Method II, and the physician or practitioner has
> reassigned his/her benefits to the CAH, the CAH bills its regular
> A/B/MAC (A) for the professional services provided at the distant site
> via a telecommunications system, in any of the revenue codes 096x,
> 097x or 098x. All requirements for billing distant site telehealth
> services apply.

### Medicare Practitioners Who May Bill for Covered Telehealth Services are Listed Below (subject to State law)

> Physician
>
> Nurse practitioner Physician assistant Nurse-midwife
>
> Clinical nurse specialist Clinical psychologist\* Clinical social
> worker\*
>
> Registered dietitian or nutrition professional Certified registered
> nurse anesthetist
>
> \*Clinical psychologists and clinical social workers cannot bill for
> psychotherapy services that include medical evaluation and management
> services under Medicare. These practitioners may not bill or receive
> payment for the following CPT codes: 90805, 90807, and 90809.

# - Submission of Telehealth Claims for Distant Site Practitioners

### (Rev. 3817; Issued; 07-28-17 Effective; 01-01-18 Implementation: 01-02-18)

> Claims for telehealth services are submitted to the contractors that
> process claims for the performing physician/practitioner's service
> area. Physicians/practitioners submit the appropriate HCPCS procedure
> code for covered professional telehealth services with place of
> service code 02 (Telehealth). By billing place of service code 02 with
> a covered telehealth procedure code, the distant site
> physician/practitioner certifies that the beneficiary was present at
> an eligible originating site when the telehealth service was
> furnished. By billing the place of service code 02 with a covered
> ESRD-related service telehealth code, the distant site
> physician/practitioner certifies that 1 visit per month was furnished
> face-to-face "hands on" to examine the vascular access site. Refer to
> section 190.3.4 of this chapter for the conditions of telehealth
> payment for ESRD-related services.
>
> In situations where a CAH has elected payment Method II for CAH
> outpatients, and the practitioner has reassigned his/her benefits to
> the CAH, CAHs submit the appropriate HCPCS procedure code for the
> covered telehealth services with the GT modifier, and A/B/MACs (A)
> should make payment for telehealth services provided by the physician
> or practitioner at 80 percent of the MPFS facility amount for the
> distant site service. In all other cases, except for MNT services as
> discussed in Section 190.7- A/B MAC (B) Editing of Telehealth Claims,
> telehealth services provided by the physician or practitioner at the
> distant site are billed to the A/B/MAC (B).
>
> Physicians and practitioners at the distant site bill their A/B/MAC
> (B) for covered telehealth services. Physicians' and practitioners'
> offices serving as a telehealth originating site bill their A/B/MAC
> (B) for the originating site facility fee.

# - Exception for Store and Forward (Noninteractive) Telehealth

### (Rev. 1, 10-01-03)

> In the case of Federal telemedicine demonstration programs conducted
> in Alaska or Hawaii, store and forward technologies may be used as a
> substitute for an interactive telecommunications system. Covered store
> and forward telehealth services are billed with the "GQ" modifier,
> "via asynchronous telecommunications system." By using the "GQ"
> modifier, the distant site physician/practitioner certifies that the
> asynchronous medical file was collected and transmitted to them at
> their distant site from a Federal telemedicine demonstration project
> conducted in Alaska or Hawaii.

# - A/B MAC (B) Editing of Telehealth Claims

### (Rev. 3817; Issued; 07-28-17 Effective; 01-01-18 Implementation: 01-02-18)

> Medicare telehealth services (as listed in section 190.3) are billed
> with POS 02. The contractor shall approve covered telehealth services
> if the physician or practitioner is licensed under State law to
> provide the service. Contractors must familiarize themselves with
> licensure provisions of States for which they process claims and
> disallow telehealth services furnished by physicians or practitioners
> who are not authorized to furnish the applicable telehealth service
> under State law. For example, if a nurse practitioner is not licensed
> to provide individual psychotherapy under State law, he or she would
> not be permitted to receive payment for individual psychotherapy under
> Medicare. The contractor shall install edits to ensure that only
> properly licensed physicians and practitioners are paid for covered

>
> If a contractor receives claims for professional telehealth services
> coded with the "GQ" modifier (representing "via asynchronous

# 200 - Allergy Testing and Immunotherapy

### (Rev. 2997, Issued: 07-25-14, Effective: Upon implementation of ICD-10; 01-01- 2012 - ASC X12, Implementation: 08-25-2014 - ASC X12; Upon Implementation of ICD-10)

A.  **Allergy Testing**

> The MPFSDB fee amounts for allergy testing services billed under codes
> 95004-95078 are established for single tests. Therefore, the number of
> tests must be shown on the claim.
>
> **EXAMPLE:** If a physician performs 25 percutaneous tests (scratch,
> puncture, or prick) with allergenic extract, the physician must bill
> code 95004 and specify 25 units. To compute payment, the Medicare A/B
> MAC (B) multiplies the payment for one test (i.e., the payment listed
> in the fee schedule) by the quantity listed in the units field.

### Allergy Immunotherapy

> For services rendered on or after January 1, 1995, all antigen/allergy
> immunotherapy services are paid for under the Medicare physician fee
> schedule. Prior to that date, only the antigen injection services,
> i.e., only codes 95115 and 95117, were paid for under the fee
> schedule. Codes representing antigens and their preparation and single
> codes representing both the antigens and their injection were paid for
> under the Medicare reasonable charge system. A legislative change
> brought all of these services under the fee schedule at the beginning
> of 1995 and the following policies are effective as of January 1,
> 1995:

1.  CPT codes 95120 through 95134 are not valid for Medicare. Codes
    > 95120 through 95134 represent complete services, i.e., services
    > that include both the injection service as well as the antigen and
    > its preparation.

2.  Separate coding for injection only codes (i.e., codes 95115
    > and 95117) and/or the codes representing antigens and their
    > preparation (i.e., codes 95144 through 95170) must be used.

> If both services are provided both codes are billed.
>
> This includes allergists who provide both services through the use of
> treatment boards.

3.  If a physician bills both an injection code plus either codes 95165
    > or 95144, A/B MACs (B) pay the appropriate injection code (i.e.,
    > code 95115 or code 95117) plus the code 95165 rate. When a
    > provider bills for codes 95115 or 95117 plus code 95144, A/B
    > MACs (B) change 95144 to 95165 and pay accordingly. Code 95144
    > (single dose vials of antigen) should be billed only if the
    > physician providing the antigen is providing it to be injected by
    > some other entity. Single dose vials, which should be used only as
    > a means of insuring proper dosage amounts for injections, are more
    > costly than multiple dose vials (i.e., code 95165) and therefore
    > their payment rate is higher. Allergists who prepare antigens are
    > assumed to be able to administer proper doses from the less costly
    > multiple dose vials. Thus, regardless of whether they use or bill
    > for single or multiple dose vials at the same time that they are
    > billing for an injection service, they are paid at the multiple
    > dose vial rate.

4.  The fee schedule amounts for the antigen codes (95144 through 95170)
    > are for a single dose. When billing those codes, physicians are to
    > specify the number of doses provided. When making payment, A/B
    > MACs (B) multiply the fee schedule amount by the number of doses
    > specified in the units field.

5.  If a patient's doses are adjusted, e.g., because of patient
    > reaction, and the antigen provided is actually more or fewer doses
    > than originally anticipated, the physician is to make no change in
    > the number of doses for which he or she bills. The number of doses
    > anticipated at the time of the antigen preparation is the number
    > of doses to be billed. This is consistent with the notes on page
    > 30 of the Spring 1994 issue of the American Medical Association's
    > CPT Assistant. Those notes indicate that the antigen codes mean
    > that the physician is to identify the number of doses
    > "prospectively planned to be provided." The physician is to
    > "identify the number of doses scheduled when the vial is
    > provided." This means that in cases where the patient actually
    > gets more doses than originally anticipated (because dose amounts
    > were decreased during treatment) and in cases where the patient
    > gets fewer doses (because dose amounts were increased), no change
    > is to be made in the billing. In the first case, A/B MACs (B) are
    > not to pay more because the number of doses provided in the
    > original vial(s) increased. In the second case, A/B MACs (B) are
    > not to seek recoupment (if A/B MACs (B) have already made payment)
    > because the number of doses is less than originally planned. This
    > is the case for both venom and nonvenom antigen codes.

6.  Venom Doses and Catch-Up Billing - Venom doses are prepared in
    > separate vials and not mixed together - except in the case of the
    > three vespid mix (white and yellow hornets and yellow jackets). A
    > dose of code 95146 (the two-venom code) means getting some of two
    > venoms. Similarly, a dose of code 95147 means getting some of
    > three venoms; a dose of code 95148 means getting some of four
    > venoms; and a dose of 95149 means getting some of five venoms.
    > Some amount of each of the venoms must be provided. Questions
    > arise when the administration of these venoms does not remain
    > synchronized because of dosage adjustments due to patient
    > reaction. For example, a physician prepares ten doses of code
    > 95148 (the four venom code) in two vials - one containing 10 doses
    > of three vespid mix and another containing 10 doses of wasp venom.
    > Because of dose adjustment, the three vespid mix doses last
    > longer, i.e., they last for 15 doses. Consequently, questions
    > arise regarding the amount of "replacement" wasp venom antigen
    > that should be prepared and how it should be billed. Medicare
    > pricing amounts have savings built into the use of the higher
    > venom codes. Therefore, if a patient is in two venom, three venom,
    > four venom or five venom therapy, the A/B MAC (B) objective is to
    > pay at the highest venom level possible. This means that, to the
    > greatest extent possible, code 95146 is to be billed for a patient
    > in two venom therapy, code 95147 is to be billed for a patient in
    > three venom therapy, code 95148 is to be billed for a patient in
    > four venom therapy, and code 95149 is to be billed for a patient
    > in five venom therapy. Thus, physicians are to be instructed that
    > the venom antigen preparation, after dose adjustment, must be done
    > in a manner that, as soon as possible, synchronizes the
    > preparation back to the highest venom code possible. In the above
    > example, the physician should prepare and bill for only 5 doses of
    > "replacement" wasp venom - billing five doses of code 95145 (the
    > one venom code). This will permit the physician to get back to
    > preparing the four venoms at one time and therefore billing the
    > doses of the "cheaper" four venom code. Use of a code below the
    > venom treatment number for the particular patient should occur
    > only for the purpose of "catching up."

7.  **Code 95165 Doses**. - Code 95165 represents preparation of vials
    > of non-venom antigens. As in the case of venoms, some non-venom
    > antigens cannot be mixed together, i.e., they must be prepared in
    > separate vials. An example of this is mold and pollen. Therefore,
    > some patients will be injected at one time from one vial -
    > containing in one mixture all of the appropriate antigens - while
    > other patients will be injected at one time from more than one
    > vial. In establishing the practice expense component for mixing a
    > multidose vial of antigens, we observed that the most common
    > practice was to prepare a 10 cc vial; we also observed that the
    > most common use was to remove aliquots with a volume of 1 cc. Our
    > PE computations were based on those facts. Therefore, a
    > physician's removing 10 1cc aliquot doses captures the entire PE
    > component for the service.

> This does not mean that the physician must remove 1 cc aliquot doses
> from a multidose vial. It means that the practice expenses payable for
> the preparation of a 10cc vial remain the same irrespective of the
> size or number of aliquots removed from the vial. Therefore, a
> physician may not bill this vial preparation code for more than 10
> doses per vial;
>
> paying more than 10 doses per multidose vial would significantly
> overpay the practice expense component attributable to this service.
> (NOTE: this code does not include the injection of antigen(s);
> injection of antigen(s) is separately billable.)
>
> When a multidose vial contains less than 10cc, physicians should bill
> Medicare for the number of 1 cc aliquots that may be removed from the
> vial. That is, a physician may bill Medicare up to a maximum of 10
> doses per multidose vial, but should bill Medicare for fewer than 10
> doses per vial when there is less than 10cc in the vial.
>
> If it is medically necessary, physicians may bill Medicare for
> preparation of more than one multidose vial.
>
> EXAMPLES:

1.  If a 10cc multidose vial is filled to 6cc with antigen, the
    > physician may bill Medicare for 6 doses since six 1cc aliquots may
    > be removed from the vial.

2.  If a 5cc multidose vial is filled completely, the physician may bill
    > Medicare for 5 doses for this vial.

3.  If a physician removes ½ cc aliquots from a 10cc multidose vial for
    > a total of 20 doses from one vial, he/she may only bill Medicare
    > for 10 doses. Billing for more than 10 doses would mean that
    > Medicare is overpaying for the practice expense of making the
    > vial.

4.  If a physician prepares two 10cc multidose vials, he/she may bill
    > Medicare for 20 doses. However, he/she may remove aliquots of any
    > amount from those vials. For example, the physician may remove ½
    > aliquots from one vial, and 1cc aliquots from the other vial, but
    > may bill no more than a total of 20 doses.

5.  If a physician prepares a 20cc multidose vial, he/she may bill
    > Medicare for 20 doses, since the practice expense is calculated
    > based on the physician's removing 1cc aliquots from a vial. If a
    > physician removes 2cc aliquots from this vial, thus getting only
    > 10 doses, he/she may nonetheless bill Medicare for 20 doses
    > because the PE for 20 doses reflects the actual practice expense
    > of preparing the vial.

6.  If a physician prepares a 5cc multidose vial, he may bill Medicare
    > for 5 doses, based on the way that the practice expense component
    > is calculated.

> However, if the physician removes ten ½ cc aliquots from the vial,
> he/she may still bill only 5 doses because the practice expense of
> preparing the vial is the same, without regard to the number of
> additional doses that are removed from the vial.

### Allergy Shots and Visit Services on the Same Day

> At the outset of the physician fee schedule, the question was posed as
> to whether visits should be billed on the same day as an allergy
> injection (CPT codes 95115-95117), since these codes have status
> indicators of A rather than T. Visits should not be billed with
> allergy injection services 95115 or 95117 unless the visit represents
> another separately identifiable service. This language parallels CPT
> editorial language that accompanies the allergen immunotherapy codes,
> which include codes 9515 and 95117. Prior to January 1, 1995, you
> appeared to be enforcing this policy through three (3) different
> means:

-   Advising physician to use modifier 25 with the visit service;

-   Denying payment for the visit unless documentation has been
    > provided; and

-   Paying for both the visit and the allergy shot if both are billed
    > for.

> For services rendered on or after January 1, 1995, you are to enforce
> the requirement that visits not be billed and paid for on the same day
> as an allergy injection through the following means. Effective for
> services rendered on or after that date, the global surgery policies
> will apply to all codes in the allergen immunotherapy series,
> including the allergy shot codes 95115 and 95117. To accomplish this,
> CMS changed the global surgery indicator for allergen immunotherapy
> codes from XXX, which meant that the global surgery concept did not
> apply to those codes, to 000, which means that the global surgery
> concept applies, but that there are no days in the postoperative
> global period.
>
> Now that the global surgery policies apply to these services, you are
> to rely on the use of modifier 25 as the only means through which you
> can make payment for visit services provided on the same day as
> allergen immunotherapy services. In order for a physician to receive
> payment for a visit service provided on the same day that the
> physician also provides a service in the allergen immunotherapy series
> (i.e., any service in the series from 95115 through 95199), the
> physician is to bill a modifier 25 with the visit code, indicating
> that the patient's condition required a significant, separately
> identifiable visit service above and beyond the allergen immunotherapy
> service provided.

### Reasonable Supply of Antigens

> See CMS Manual System, Internet Only Manual, Medicare Benefits Policy
> Manual, CMS Pub. 100-02 Chapter 15, section 50.4.4, regarding the
> coverage of antigens, including what constitutes a reasonable supply
> of antigens.

# - Application of the Limitation

### (Rev. 2166, Issued: 02-25-11, Effective: 03-25-11, Implementation: 03-25-11)

A.  **Status of Patient**

> The limitation is applicable to expenses incurred in connection with
> the treatment of an individual who is not an inpatient of a hospital.
> Thus, the limitation applies to mental health services furnished to a
> person in a physician's office, in the patient's home, in a skilled
> nursing facility, as an outpatient, and so forth. The term "hospital"
> in this context means an institution, which is primarily engaged in
> providing to inpatients, by or under the supervision of a
> physician(s):

-   Diagnostic and therapeutic services for medical diagnosis, treatment
    > and care of injured, disabled, or sick persons;

-   Rehabilitation services for injured, disabled, or sick persons; or

-   Psychiatric services for the diagnosis and treatment of mentally ill
    > patients.

### Disorders Subject to the Limitation

> The term "mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders" is
> defined as the specific psychiatric diagnoses described in the
> International Classification of Diseases, 9^th^ Revision (ICD-9),
> under the code range 290-319.
>
> When the treatment services rendered are both for a psychiatric
> diagnosis as defined in the ICD-9 and one or more nonpsychiatric
> conditions, separate the expenses for the psychiatric aspects of
> treatment from the expenses for the nonpsychiatric aspects of
>
> treatment. However, in any case in which the psychiatric treatment
> component is not readily distinguishable from the nonpsychiatric
> treatment component, all of the expenses are allocated to whichever
> component constitutes the primary diagnosis.

1.  Diagnosis Clearly Meets Definition - If the primary diagnosis
    > reported for a particular service is the same as or equivalent to
    > a condition described in the ICD- 9 under the code range 290-319
    > that represents mental, psychoneurotic and personality disorders,
    > the expense for the service is subject to the limitation except as
    > described in subsection D.

2.  Diagnosis Does Not Clearly Meet Definition - When it is not clear
    > whether the primary diagnosis reported meets the definition of
    > mental, psychoneurotic, and personality disorders, it may be
    > necessary to contact the practitioner to clarify the diagnosis. In
    > deciding whether contact is necessary in a given case, give
    > consideration to such factors as the type of services rendered,
    > the diagnosis, and the individual's previous utilization history.

### Services Subject to the Limitation

> A/B MACs (B) must apply the limitation to claims for professional
> services that represent mental health treatment furnished to
> individuals who are not hospital inpatients by physicians, clinical
> psychologists, clinical social workers, nurse practitioners, clinical
> nurse specialists and physician assistants. Items and supplies
> furnished by physicians or other mental health practitioners in
> connection with treatment are also subject to the limitation.
>
> Generally, A/B MACs (B) must apply the limitation only to treatment
> services. However, diagnostic psychological and neuropsychological
> testing services performed to evaluate a patient's progress during
> treatment are considered part of treatment and are subject to the
> limitation.

### Services Not Subject to the Limitation

1.  Diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or Related Disorder - When the
    > primary diagnosis reported for a particular service is Alzheimer's
    > Disease or an Alzheimer's related disorder, A/B MACs (B) must look
    > to the nature of the service that has been rendered in determining
    > whether it is subject to the limitation. Alzheimer's disease is
    > coded 331.0 in the "International Classification of Diseases,
    > 9^th^ Revision", which is outside the code range 290-319 that
    > represents mental, psychoneurotic and personality disorders.
    > Additionally, Alzheimer's related disorders are identified by A/B
    > MACs (B) under ICD-9 codes that are within the 290-319 code range
    > (290.XX or others as A/B MACs (B) determine appropriate) or
    > outside the 290-319 code range as determined appropriate by A/B
    > MACs (B). When the primary treatment rendered to a patient with a
    > diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease or a related disorder is
    > psychotherapy, it is subject to the limitation. However,
    > typically, treatment provided to a patient

> with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease or a related disorder
> represents medical management of the patient's condition (such as
> described under CPT code 90862 or any successor code) and is not
> subject to the limitation. CPT code 90862 describes pharmacologic
> management, including prescription, use, and review of medication with
> no more than minimal medical psychotherapy.

2.  Brief Office Visits for Monitoring or Changing Drug Prescriptions -
    > Brief office visits for the sole purpose of monitoring or changing
    > drug prescriptions used in the treatment of mental, psychoneurotic
    > and personality disorders are not subject to the limitation. These
    > visits are reported using HCPCS code M0064 or any successor code
    > (brief office visit for the sole purpose of monitoring or changing
    > drug prescriptions used in the treatment of mental,
    > psychoneurotic, and personality disorders). Claims where the
    > diagnosis reported is a mental, psychoneurotic, or personality
    > disorder (other than a diagnosis specified in subsection A) are
    > subject to the limitation except for the procedure identified by
    > HCPCS code M0064 or any successor code.

3.  Diagnostic Services - A/B MACs (B) do not apply the limitation to
    > psychiatric diagnostic evaluations and diagnostic psychological
    > and neuropsychological tests performed to establish or confirm the
    > patient's diagnosis. Diagnostic services include psychiatric
    > diagnostic evaluations billed under CPT codes 90801 or 90802 (or
    > any successor codes) and, psychological and neuropsychological
    > tests billed under CPT code range 96101-96118 (or any successor
    > code range).

> An initial visit to a practitioner for professional services often
> combines diagnostic evaluation and the start of therapy. Such a visit
> is neither solely diagnostic nor solely therapeutic. Therefore, A/B
> MACs (B) must deem the initial visit to be diagnostic so that the
> limitation does not apply. Separating diagnostic and therapeutic
> components of a visit is not administratively feasible, unless the
> practitioner already has separately identified them on the bill.
>
> Determining the entire visit to be therapeutic is not justifiable
> since some diagnostic work must be done before even a tentative
> diagnosis can be made and certainly before therapy can be instituted.
> Moreover, the patient should not be disadvantaged because therapeutic
> as well as diagnostic services were provided in the initial visit. In
> the rare cases where a practitioner's diagnostic services take more
> than one visit, A/B MACs (B) must not apply the limitation to the
> additional visits. However, it is expected such cases are few.
> Therefore, when a practitioner bills for more than one visit for
> professional diagnostic services, A/B MACs (B) may find it necessary
> to request documentation to justify the reason for more than one
> diagnostic visit.

4.  Partial Hospitalization Services Not Directly Provided by a
    > Physician or a Practitioner - The limitation does not apply to
    > partial hospitalization services that are not directly provided by
    > a physician, clinical psychologist, nurse practitioner, clinical
    > nurse specialist or a physician assistant. Partial hospitalization
    > services are billed by hospital outpatient departments and
    > community mental health

> centers (CMHCs) to A/B MACs (A). However, services furnished by
> physicians, clinical psychologists, nurse practitioners, clinical
> nurse specialists, and physician assistants to partial hospitalization
> patients are billed separately from the partial hospitalization
> program of services. Accordingly, these professional's mental health
> services to partial hospitalization patients are paid under the
> physician fee schedule by A/B MACs (B) and may be subject to the
> limitation. (See chapter 4, section 260.1C).

### Computation of Limitation

> A/B MACs (B) determine the Medicare approved payment amount for
> services subject to the limitation. They:

-   Multiply the approved amount by the limitation percentage amount;

-   Subtract any unsatisfied deductible; and,

-   Multiply the remainder by 0.8 to obtain the amount of Medicare
    > payment.

> The beneficiary is responsible for the difference between the amount
> paid by Medicare and the full Medicare approved amount.
>
> The following examples illustrate the application of the limitation in
> various circumstances as it is gradually reduced under section 102 of
> the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act (MIPPA).
> Please note that although the calendar year 2009 Part B deductible of
> \$135 is used under these examples, the actual deductible amount for
> calendar year 2010 and future years is unknown and will be subject to
> change.
>
> [Example #1:]{.underline} In 2010, a clinical psychologist submits a
> claim for \$200 for outpatient treatment of a patient's mental
> disorder. The Medicare-approved amount is \$180. Since clinical
> psychologists must accept assignment, the patient is not liable for
> the \$20 in excess charges. The patient previously satisfied the \$135
> annual Part B deductible. The limitation reduces the amount of
> incurred expenses to 68 ¾ percent of the approved amount. Medicare
> pays 80 percent of the remaining incurred expenses. The Medicare
> payment and patient liability are computed as follows:

1.  Actual charges \$200.00

2.  Medicare-approved amount \$180.00

3.  Medicare incurred expenses (0.6875 x line 2) \$123.75

4.  Unmet deductible \$0.00

5.  Remainder after subtracting deductible (line 3 minus line 4)
    > \$123.75

6.  Medicare payment (0.80 x line 5) \$99.00

7.  Patient liability (line 2 minus line 6) \$81.00

> [Example #2:]{.underline} In 2012, a clinical social worker submits a
> claim for \$135 for outpatient treatment of a patient's mental
> disorder. The Medicare-approved amount is \$120. Since clinical social
> workers must accept assignment, the patient is not liable for the \$15
> in
>
> excess charges. The limitation reduces the amount of incurred expenses
> to 75 percent of the approved amount. The patient previously satisfied
> \$70 of the \$135 annual Part B deductible, leaving \$65 unmet. The
> Medicare payment and patient liability are computed as follows:

1.  Actual charges \$135.00

2.  Medicare-approved amount \$120.00

3.  Medicare incurred expenses (0.75 x line 2) \$90.00

4.  Unmet deductible \$65.00

5.  Remainder after subtracting deductible (line 3 minus line 4) \$25.00

6.  Medicare payment (0.80 x line 5) \$20.00

7.  Patient liability (line 2 minus line 6) \$100.00

> [Example #3:]{.underline} In calendar year 2013, a physician who does
> not accept assignment submits a claim for \$780 for services in
> connection with the treatment of a mental disorder that did not
> require inpatient hospitalization. The Medicare-approved amount is
> \$750.
>
> Because the physician does not accept assignment, the patient is
> liable for the \$30 in excess charges. The patient has not satisfied
> any of the \$135 Part B annual deductible. The Medicare payment and
> patient liability are computed as follows:

1.  Actual charges \$780.00

2.  Medicare-approved amount \$750.00

3.  Medicare incurred expenses (0.8125 x line 2) \$609.38

4.  Unmet deductible \$135.00

5.  Remainder after subtracting deductible (line 3 minus line 4)
    > \$474.38

6.  Medicare payment (0.80 x line 5) \$379.50

7.  Patient liability (line 1 minus line 6) \$400.50

> [Example #4:]{.underline} A patient's Part B expenses during calendar
> year 2014 are for a physician's services in connection with the
> treatment of a mental disorder that initially required inpatient
> hospitalization, with subsequent physician services furnished on an
> outpatient basis. The patient has not satisfied any of the \$135 Part
> B deductible. The physician accepts assignment and submits a claim for
> \$780. The Medicare-approved amount is
>
> \$750. Since the limitation will be completely phased out as of
> January 1, 2014, the entire
>
> \$750 Medicare-approved amount is recognized as the total incurred
> expenses because such expenses are no longer reduced. Also, there is
> no longer any distinction between mental health services the patient
> receives as an inpatient or outpatient. The Medicare payment and
> patient liability are computed as follows:

1.  Actual charges \$780.00

2.  Medicare-approved amount \$750.00

3.  Medicare incurred expenses (1.00 x line 2) \$750.00

4.  Unmet deductible \$135.00

5.  Remainder after subtracting deductible (line 3 minus line 4)

### (Rev. 3721, Issued: 02-24-17, Effective: 05-25-17, Implementation: 05-25-17)

A.  **Verification of Chiropractor\'s Qualifications**

> Establish a reference file of chiropractors eligible for payment as
> physicians under the criteria in Pub. 100-02, Benefits Policy Manual,
> Chapter 15, Sections 30.5 & 240A. Pay only chiropractors on file.
> Information needed to establish such files is furnished by the RO.
>
> The RO is notified by the appropriate State agency which chiropractors
> are licensed and whether each meets the national uniform standards.

### Durable Medical Equipment Regional Carriers Processing Claims When a Chiropractor is the Supplier

> Effective July 1, 1999, except for restrictions to chiropractor
> services as stipulated in
>
> §§1861(s)(2)(A) of the Social Security Act, chiropractors (specialty
> 35) can bill for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and

### Documentation

> The following information must be recorded by the chiropractor and
> kept on file. The date of the initial treatment or date of
> exacerbation of the existing condition must be entered in Item 14 of
> Form CMS-1500. This serves as affirmation by the chiropractor that all
> documentation required as listed below and in Pub. 100-02, Benefits
> Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 240.1.2 is being maintained on file
> by the chiropractor.

1.  Specification of the precise spinal location and level of
    subluxation (see Pub. 100-02, Benefits Policy Manual, Chapter 15,
    Section 240.1.4) giving rise to the diagnosis and symptoms.

2.  Effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 1,
    2000, the x-ray is no longer [required]{.underline}. However, the
    x-ray [may]{.underline} still be used to demonstrate subluxation for
    claims processing purposes. Effective for claims with dates of
    service on or after October 1, 2000, when the x-ray is used to
    demonstrate subluxation, the date of the x-ray must be entered in
    Item 19 of Form CMS-1500 and the date must be within the parameters
    specified in Pub. 100-02, Benefits Policy Manual, Chapter 15,
    Section 240.1.2.

> For claims with dates of service prior to January 1, 2000, and for
> claims with dates of service on or after October 1, 2000, for which an
> x-ray is still used to show subluxation, the following instructions on
> documentation apply:
>
> An x-ray film (including the date of the film) is available for your
> review demonstrating the existence of a subluxation at the specified
> level of the spine. If the beneficiary refuses to have the x-ray, the
> chiropractor must submit one of the appropriate HCPCS codes for
> chiropractic manipulation in addition to modifier GX (service not
> covered by Medicare), and the claim will be denied as a technical
> denial.

### X-ray Review

> Effective for claims with dates of service on and after January 1,
> 2000, the x-ray is no longer required. However, effective for claims
> with dates of service on or after October 1, 2000, should the
> chiropractor choose to use the x-ray to show subluxation, the x-ray
> review process is still required as outlined below minus the
> requirement in the last sentence of number 2. For claims with dates of
> service prior to January 1, 2000, all aspects of the following
> instructions still apply.

1.  Carriers should conduct post-payment reviews of x-rays on a sample
    > basis. Prepayment review should be undertaken in all questionable
    > cases.

2.  It is the responsibility of the treating chiropractor to make the
    > documenting x- ray(s) available to the carrier\'s review staff. If
    > x-rays are not made available, or suggest a pattern in failing to
    > demonstrate subluxation for any reason, including unacceptable
    > technical quality, the carrier should conduct prepayment review of
    > x-rays in 100 percent of the subsequent claims for treatments by
    > the practitioner

> involved until satisfied that the deficiency will no longer occur.
> Where there is no x-ray documentation of subluxation on prepayment
> review, the claims, of course, should be denied. (The last sentence of
> this paragraph only refers to claims with dates of service prior to
> January 1, 2000.)

3.  The x-ray film(s) must have been taken at a time reasonably
    > proximate to the initiation of the course of treatment and must
    > demonstrate a subluxation at the level of the spine specified by
    > the treating chiropractor on the claim. (See Pub. 100-02, Benefits
    > Policy Manual, Chapter 15, Section 240.1.2.)

4.  An x-ray obtained by the chiropractor for his own diagnostic
    > purposes before commencing treatment should suffice for claims
    > documentation purposes. However, when subluxation was for
    > treatment purposes diagnosed by some other

> means and x-rays are taken to satisfy Medicare\'s documentation
> requirement, carriers should ask chiropractors to hone in on the site
> of the subluxation in producing x-rays. Such a practice would not only
> minimize the exposure of the patient but also should result in a film
> more clearly portraying the subluxation.

5.  An x-ray will be considered of acceptable technical quality if any
    > individual trained in the reading of x-rays could recognize a
    > subluxation if present.

6.  When claims have been denied because the x-ray(s) initially offered
    > failed to document the existence of a subluxation requiring
    > treatment, no review of these decisions should be undertaken on
    > the basis of x-ray(s) subsequently taken. Permitting such reviews
    > could be an inducement to excessive exposure of patients to
    > radiation in cases where the decision to treat was made despite
    > x-rays that did not show a subluxation.

# - Definition of Primary Care Practitioners and Primary Care Services

### (Rev. 2152, Issued: 02-11-11, Effective: 07-01-11, Implementation: 07-05-11)

> Primary care practitioner is defined as:

1.  A physician who has a primary specialty designation of family
    > medicine, internal medicine, geriatric medicine, or pediatric
    > medicine for whom primary care services accounted for at least 60
    > percent of the allowed charges under the PFS (excluding hospital
    > inpatient care and emergency department visits) for the
    > practitioner in a prior period as determined appropriate by the
    > Secretary; or

2.  A nurse practitioner, clinical nurse specialist, or physician
    > assistant for whom primary care services accounted for at least 60
    > percent of the allowed charges under the PFS (excluding hospital
    > inpatient care and emergency department visits) for the
    > practitioner in a prior period as determined appropriate by the
    > Secretary.

> Primary care services are defined as HCPCS Codes:

1.  99201 through 99215 for new and established patient office or
    > outpatient evaluation and management (E/M) visits;

2.  99304 through 99340 for initial, subsequent, discharge, and other
    > nursing facility E/M services; new and established patient
    > domiciliary, rest home or custodial care E/M services; and
    > domiciliary, rest home or home care plan oversight services; and

3.  99341 through 99350 for new and established patient home E/M visits.

> Practitioner Identification
>
> Primary care practitioners will be identified using the National
> Provider Identifier (NPI) number of the rendering practitioner on
> claims. If the claim is submitted by a practitioner's group practice,
> the rendering practitioner's NPI must be included on the line-item for
> the primary care service and reflect an eligible HCPCS as identified.
> In order to be eligible for the PCIP, physician assistants, clinical
> nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners must be billing for their
> services under their own NPI and not furnishing services incident to
> physicians' services. Regardless of the specialty area in which they
> may be practicing, the specific nonphysician practitioners are
> eligible for the PCIP based on their profession and historical
> percentage of allowed charges as primary care services that equals or
> exceeds the 60 percent threshold.
>
> The claims data used for the primary care percentage calculations
> depend on the potential primary care practitioner's date of enrollment
> in Medicare. We will use Medicare claims data 2 years prior to the
> PCIP payment year to determine PCIP eligibility for those potential
> primary care practitioners who were enrolled in Medicare in that year.
> For example, for CY 2011, we will use Medicare claims data from CY
> 2009 for practitioners who were already enrolled in Medicare in CY
> 2009. We will use claims data from the year immediately preceding the
> PCIP payment year in order to determine PCIP eligibility for potential
> primary care practitioners who newly enroll in Medicare in the year
> immediately preceding the PCIP payment year. For example, for CY 2011,

> method, see the Medicare Claims Processing Manual, Pub. 100-04,
> Chapter 4, §250.12.
>
> On an annual basis A/B MACs (B) shall receive a Primary Care Incentive
> Payment Program Eligibility File and PCIP Payment for New Providers
> Enrolled in Medicare File that they shall post to their websites. The
> files will list the NPIs of all practitioners who are eligible to
> receive PCIP payments for the PCIP payment year.

B.  ### Method of Payment

    -   Calculate and pay qualifying primary care practitioners an
        > additional 10 percent incentive payment.

    -   Calculate the payment based on the amount actually paid for the
        > services, not the Medicare approved amount.

    -   Combine the PCIP incentive payments, when appropriate, with
        > other incentive payments, including the HPSA physician bonus
        > payment, and the HPSA Surgical Incentive Payment Program
        > (HSIP) payment;

    -   Provide a special remittance form that is forwarded with the
        > incentive payment so that physicians and practitioners can
        > identify which type of incentive payment (HPSA physician
        > and/or PCIP) was paid for which services.

    -   Practitioners should contact their A/B MAC (B) with any
        > questions regarding PCIP payments.

C.  ### Changes for Contractor Systems

> The Medicare Carrier System, (MCS), Common Working File (CWF) and the
> National Claims History (NCH) shall be modified to accept a new PCIP
> indicator on the claim line. Once the type of incentive payment has
> been identified by the shared systems, the shared system shall modify
> their systems to set the indicator on the claim line as follows:
>
> 1 = HPSA;
>
> 2 = PSA;
>
> 3 = HPSA and PSA;
>
> 4 = HSIP;
>
> 5 = HPSA and HSIP;
>
> 6 = PCIP;
>
> 7 = HPSA and PCIP; and Space = Not Applicable.
>
> The MCS shall send the HIGLAS 810 invoice for incentive payment
> invoices, including the new PCIP payment. The A/B MAC (B) shall also
> combine the provider's HPSA physician bonus, physician scarcity (PSA)
> bonus (if it should become available at a later date), HSIP payment
> and/or PCIP payment invoice per provider. The A/B MAC (B) shall
> receive the HIGLAS 835 payment file from HIGLAS showing a single
> incentive payment per provider.
